The World Health Organisation said it is in ongoing contact with authorities in China over an unidentified outbreak of viral pneumonia in the central city of Wuhan, amid concern it may have been transmitted from animals. Wuhan health authorities on Tuesday said 27 people – most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market – had been treated in hospital, with seven said to be in serious condition. Pathology tests were under way to try and identify the virus, officials said. Hong Kong medical authorities were also on alert. Wuhan authorities ordered the closure of the market on Wednesday. Local media said the market sold other animals, including birds, raising concern after the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China killed several hundred people and is thought to have jumped from animals to humans. Officials in China and at the WHO said the virus in Wuhan had yet to be identified. “Investigations are still being carried out and authorities cannot yet confirm what pathogen is causing this illness,” said Paige Snider, a senior adviser with the WHO in China, adding that the organisation had been in contact with Chinese authorities. “There are many potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. WHO is closely monitoring this event and will share more details as we have them,” she said. Online news outlet Hongxing, an affiliate of Chengdu Economic Daily , reported late on Tuesday that the market sold other wildlife, including pheasants and snakes. It also said the organs of rabbits and other animals were found in the market. A seafood vendor surnamed Sun confirmed the Hongxing report, saying such animals were available for sale in the market. Medical authorities in Hong Kong , which is about four hours from Wuhan by high-speed train, said late on Tuesday they had stepped up border screening and put hospitals in the city on alert. “The situation in Wuhan is unusual, and we are not sure about the reasons behind the outbreak yet,” Hong Kong’s Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said after a meeting with officials and experts on New Year’s Eve. “Since we are now in the holiday season, and Hong Kong has close transport ties with Wuhan, we must stay alert.” Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said that although the Wuhan case had similarities to the 1997 outbreak of bird flu and the Sars epidemic, there was no need for people to panic though they should remain alert. “There are chances that the virus was transmitted from animals to humans, but so far the authorities have not identified the virus,” he said on Tuesday before the Hongxing report. Law enforcement officers wearing face masks were on guard outside the market on Wednesday morning as seafood vendors were allowed to remove their stocks, the official Yangtze Daily reported. The city’s health and commerce regulators issued the notice to close the market. “After considering the municipal health commission’s report about the current pneumonia situation in the city, it is decided that Huanan seafood market will be closed for sanitation and renovation … the date for reopening will be announced later,” the notice said. News of the outbreak in Wuhan came to light after an urgent notice from the city’s health department, which told hospitals to report further cases of “pneumonia of unknown origin”, started circulating on social media on Monday night. The 2002-03 Sars epidemic infected more than more than 5,300 people and killed 349 in mainland China. In Hong Kong, 1,750 people were infected and 299 died. According to the WHO, the Sars coronavirus is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals and first infected humans in Guangdong, near Hong Kong, in late 2002. \\n Sign up now for our 50% early bird offer from SCMP Research: China AI Report.

All patients are being treated in quarantine, and no deaths have been reported.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), symptoms of the pneumonia are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs.\nThe outbreak came to light in late December and prompted fears in China of a possible resurgence of SARS, an acute viral respiratory illness first reported in the country in 2002 that caused a pandemic that ripped through Asia.\nSARS spread to 37 countries worldwide, infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 from November 2002 to July 2003. The illness is brought on by a coronavirus, and symptoms include fever, cough, severe headache, dizziness and other flu-like complaints.\nAmid growing disquiet, Wuhan authorities said on Sunday they had excluded the possibility of SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and bird flu.\nIf not SARS, then what is it?\nAccording to the Wuhan health commission, the infection broke out between December 12 and December 29, with some of the patients employed at a seafood market in the city.\nLocal media reported that the market -- which has been closed since January 1 for disinfection -- also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes, sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals.\nProfessor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it is highly likely that the outbreak was caused by a \"brand-new viral pneumonia.\"\n\"The concern now is whether the game (sold at the market) is one of the reasons for the outbreak,\" he told CNN.\nAccording to Hui, many new pathogens have been transmitted to humans from animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic first broke out. And dromedary camels are considered a likely source of MERS, he said.\nAuthorities have said that there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission so far, and no health care workers have been infected. At least 163 people who have had close contact with those infected have been placed under medical observation.\nBut there are still fears of a nationwide epidemic. The outbreak came just before the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel season, when hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to be crammed into trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Millions of Chinese are also expected to travel overseas around Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25.\nProfessor Leo Poon, a virologist at Hong Kong University and a SARS expert, said the severity of the situation to come depends on whether the pneumonia in Wuhan can be transmitted among humans.\n\"If it only transmits from animals to humans, now that the market has been shut down and sanitized, the chances for people to be infected will be low,\" he said.\nHui, from Chinese University, said the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out.\n\"Most often, respiratory viruses can be transmitted among humans. It is only a matter of how contagious it is,\" he said.\nAsia steps up screening\nThe current outbreak in Wuhan has put Asian governments on close watch, stepping up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and notification requirements.\nIn Hong Kong, 21 people have been found with fever or respiratory symptoms after returning from Wuhan, according to the city's Hospital Authority. Seven of them have been discharged, and so far none of them has been linked to the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan. Travelers arriving from Wuhan are also being screened at Hong Kong airport.\nIn Singapore, travelers arriving from the Chinese city are also required to go through temperature screening, according to the Ministry of Health. Doctors have been alerted to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who recently returned from there.\nIn South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a quarantine task force and warned visitors to Wuhan not to touch wild animals or poultry, or visit local markets.\nTaiwan on Sunday stepped up measures by expanding the conditions for notification of suspected cases of Wuhan pneumonia, according to government-run news agency CNA.\nThe World Health Organization said in a statement Sunday that \"there is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology.\"\nIt said it does not recommend any specific measures for travelers, and \"advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the current information available on this event.\"\nFall and winter months are traditionally prone to flu epidemics. In the United States, the current flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.\nHe said while it is impossible to predict how the flu will play out, the season so far is on track to be as severe as the 2017-18 flu season, which was the deadliest in more than four decades, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

So far tests have ruled out influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The city is home to one of China's top labs, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nSome experts wonder if a novel coronavirus might be the cause of the outbreak. Hong Kong respirator shortage\nHong Kong has identified 9 more sick travelers who recently visited Wuhan, and tests have already identified common respiratory viruses in four of them. According to the administrative region's Centre for Health Protection (CHP), 30 sick travelers have been evaluated since Dec 31, and 13 have been discharged.\nIn a related development, the CHP added unidentified pneumonia to its list of notifiable diseases, a step that gives authorities quarantine power. Also, the CHP announced a precautionary measure for blood donation, which said people who have visited Wuhan should defer donation for 14 days from their departure date.\nMeanwhile, public fears of the unknown respiratory illness outbreak in a city hit by the SARS outbreak in 2003 have increased demand for N95 respirators, and supplies are running low in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported today.\nSome retailers have doubled or tripled the price of the masks in response to the increased demand, though doctors have said there's no signs that any cluster-related cases have been detected in Hong Kong. Screening in Vietnam; US Embassy alert\nIn Vietnam, the health ministry has asked hospitals to monitor patients from or who have recently visited Wuhan and asked health departments to increase health checks at border gates and use remote body temperature devices, VN Express International, an online newspaper based in Hanoi, reported today.\nAlso, the US Embassy & Consulates in China today posted a health alert about Wuhan's unidentified pneumonia outbreak, following a US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alert yesterday.\nThe US Embassy urged travelers to Wuhan to avoid live or dead animals, animal markets, and products that come from animals such as uncooked meat. It also advised travelers to avoid contact with sick people and to wash hands often with soap and water.\nIt also listed steps for Wuhan travelers who feel sick, including staying home except when seeking medical care, avoiding travel when sick, and calling ahead to the clinic or emergency department before seeking care.\nSee also: ", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://www.xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://www.rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms", "http://www.purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.purl.org/dc/terms/"], "published": "2020-01-07T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-08T00:59:05.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T18:57:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The report on CCTV appears to be the first official confirmation from Chinese authorities that they believe a new virus is responsible for this outbreak — specifically a coronavirus, a type of virus in the family that includes SARS and MERS.\nWhen viewed under an electron microscope, it exhibits the crown-like halo that gives coronaviruses their name, said Xu Jianguo, identified by CCTV as the leader of the preliminary assessment of the test results and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\nThe outbreak is occurring in Wuhan, about 700 miles south of Beijing. Wuhan is a leading center for virology research in China, and infectious diseases experts watching this outbreak have predicted scientists there would quickly find the cause.\n“The virology team investigating this outbreak at Wuhan and China CDC are world class and they are making good progress on identifying the causative agent,” Malik Peiris, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, told STAT.\nPeiris was one of the scientists who first identified the coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in China, Hong Kong, and several other Asian countries as well as in Toronto, Canada.\nThe first known case in the Wuhan outbreak became noticeably ill on Dec. 12, according to a statement released Sunday by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The discovery of an outbreak and identification of a new virus in a period of less than one month is exceptional, experts said.\n“I am stunned by the timeline and speed of this isolation and characterization, if it’s all true,” said Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe community of scientists who research emerging infectious diseases has been speculating for days that the source of the outbreak was a new coronavirus, a class of viruses that has shown itself adept at making the leap from animals to people. Coronaviruses originate in bats but are able to infect a number of mammals.\nConfirmation that scientists have the genetic sequence of the virus will increase pressure on China to release at least part of that sequence, so that health facilities around the world know what to look for as they try to detect possible cases from this outbreak.\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday instructed doctors to ask patients with severe respiratory infections whether they have been to Wuhan. Hong Kong and other countries in Southeast Asia are isolating any such cases until they can be tested for influenza, rhinoviruses, and other viruses that cause colds and flu.\nNewsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.\nPlease enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human: This type of very broad net will draw in many people who were in or near Wuhan and who have a respiratory tract infection but who have nothing to do with this outbreak — especially in the middle of flu season. That will eat up resources and the time of doctors, laboratories, and sick people who don’t need to be isolated.\n“If the Chinese truly have sequenced the virus and they’ve demonstrated that it’s present in other patients, that’s means there’s a PCR diagnostic test available. And the Chinese need to make that available to the rest of the world immediately,” said Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina.\n“And the longer they wait, the more likely the scientific community will go from a positive response to a negative response, in terms of how China is handling this outbreak,” he said.\nThe CCTV report did not provide details on the type of coronavirus that has been discovered — for instance if it is one of several SARS-like viruses that have been found in bats in China. A number of these SARS-like viruses are able to infect human tissue cells in the laboratory, suggesting they might be able to spill over into people if given the right circumstances.\nXu said more research on the new virus is needed.\nThere has been limited information about the nature of the illness in people who have been infected. Chinese authorities have said no one has died from this infection; seven, however, were in critical condition as of Sunday. In a statement that same day, the WHO said that the main symptom was fever; some patients had difficulty breathing.\nThe CCTV report also did not indicate whether scientists investigating the outbreak had identified the source of the virus.\nBaris said coronaviruses could jump to people directly from bats, which are eaten in China. But this virus could have used what is known as an intermediate host — an animal species that becomes infected with a bat virus that then transmits it to people.\nDuring the SARS outbreak, it was determined that palm civets, a wild animal eaten as a delicacy in southern China, were transmitting the virus. Chinese authorities ordered a widespread culling of civets to help stop the outbreak.\nThe Wuhan outbreak has been linked to a large seafood market that also sells live exotic animals for consumption. The market was closed and decontaminated on Jan. 1. But it is important to know if other markets are selling infected animals, Peiris said.\n“If it can jump once, then it will jump again,” he said of the virus.\nThe WHO said Wednesday that Chinese authorities believe the virus “does not transmit readily between people.”\nEarlier statements from the Wuhan Municipal Health Authority said there has been no person-to-person spread, but disease experts challenged that claim, saying it is impossible to rule out at this stage in the exploration of a new disease.\n“I don’t know how you know that at all,” Frieman said of China’s claim there is no person-to-person transmission. He noted the number of cases reported makes it seem unlikely that animal-to-human transmission is the only way this virus spread.\nThere have been at least one or two clusters of cases within families that have raised suspicions of limited person-to-person spread, a source familiar with the outbreak told STAT.\nNews of the pneumonia cases first emerged on Dec. 30, when the local health authority told hospitals to be on the lookout for cases. The next day Chinese authorities informed the WHO that they were dealing with what looked like an outbreak caused by an unknown virus.", "external_links": ["https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00424.asp", "https://www.emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00424.asp"], "published": "2020-01-09T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T16:09:06.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

David Cyranoski Google Scholar Passengers arriving at Hong Kong's international airport are being monitored for signs a mystery illness that emerged in central China. Credit: Andy Wong/AP/Shutterstock\nChinese researchers are racing to uncover the cause of a mysterious respiratory illness that has infected almost 60 people in central China. Authorities have ruled out the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds of people there in 2002–03. But missteps during that disaster may explain why scientists are being cautious about releasing information on the latest outbreak, say researchers outside the country.\nAs of 5 January, 59 people in the east-central city of Wuhan have been infected with the mystery virus, with 7 in a critical condition, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The health commission says that it has also ruled out Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza and other influenza viruses as the cause, based on advice from infectious disease experts in China, including researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which houses one of the country’s premier biosafety laboratories . Symptoms of the illness include fever and difficulty breathing, which are common to several respiratory diseases, according to the World Health Organization, which released an emergency preparedness report on the same day.\nThe municipal health commission says that it is trying to isolate the virus from patients to identify the pathogen and its potential source. Many of the people who have become ill work in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, which was shut down on 1 January. The health commission says there’s no evidence that the infection is being passed between people, suggesting it is not transmitted easily in humans.\nThe infection is probably an emerging zoonotic virus — infections that spread from animals to humans, says Linfa Wang, a virologist at Duke–National University of Singapore. Such infections often first appear in colder months when animal pathogens can survive and spread to people, he says.\nBut the scientists studying the pathogen are unlikely to release their findings until they’re confident with the result, says Wang, who works on emerging viruses with Chinese research groups but hasn’t been involved in this outbreak. He thinks many scientists will remember how, in the early months of the SARS outbreak before it had been identified as a coronavirus, some Chinese scientists announced prematurely that cases of atypical pneumonia were caused by chlamydia, delaying measures to contain the outbreak. Wang says that this is likely why scientists are being cautious about releasing information about this latest illness.\nChristian Drosten, a virologist at the Charité – University Medicine Berlin, suspects that the researchers have already identified the virus, but are waiting for government permission to announce their results, or have them confirmed in other laboratories. “There are good reasons to not communicate results early,” he says.\nDrosten thinks the pathogen might be a coronavirus that is related to SARS, which also points to an animal source.\nAlthough the virus currently shows no signs of being transmitted between people, it could develop that capacity over time and lead to and epidemic, says Seungtaek Kim, a virologist at the Institut Pasteur Korea in Seongnam, South Korea. “Since we do not know the identity of this pathogen, it would be safe to treat this outbreak as SARS to prevent further spread,” he says.\nThe health commission has isolated the infected people and is monitoring those in close contact with them, as well as looking for related cases that might have been missed.\nAuthorities in nearby Hong Kong and South Korea have also started screening travelers who have recently been to Wuhan. In Hong Kong, 30 people who had recently visited Wuhan presented with respiratory illness. Authorities say that most had influenza or other infections, but ten of these cases are still unidentified.\nThe current spate of infections seem to be less serious than the 2002–03 SARS outbreak, says Wang, because there have been no deaths, or reports of medical staff becoming ill — usually a sign that an infection is spreading among people and might cause an outbreak. doi: 10.1038/d41586-020-00020-9", "external_links": ["https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_sauthors=%22David%2BCyranoski%22", "https://who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/", "https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en", "https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar", "https://chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/enhanced_sur_pneumonia_wuhan_eng.pdf", "https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/", "https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/enhanced_sur_pneumonia_wuhan_eng.pdf", "https://www.scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_sauthors=%22David%2BCyranoski%22"], "published": "2020-01-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T01:56:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it’s possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

Some of the virus types cause less severe disease, while some - like the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - are far more severe.\n\"The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan...pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster,\" the WHO said in a statement.\nIt added that since Chinese authorities have conducted laboratory tests and eliminated the SARS coronavirus and the MERS one as possible causes, as well as flu, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens, \"therefore, a novel coronavirus could not be ruled out\".\nThe pneumonia outbreak started last month, and 59 cases had been reported by Chinese authorities by Sunday.\nThe WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically - including in 2002 to cause SARS and in 2012 to cause MERS.\nIt said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person.\n\"More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection, and the countermeasures implemented,\" the WHO said.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003.

Credit: Lauren DeCicca World Health Organization confirmed on Wednesday that Chinese authorities believe a new coronavirus—from the family that produced SARS and MERS—may be the cause of mysterious pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan.\nThe Chinese government has not yet publicly stated that a coronavirus is the cause of the illness, which has infected at least 59 people. But the Wall Street Journal reported that was the case earlier Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.\n“Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to SARS. Some cause less-severe disease, some more severe. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others don’t,” the WHO statement said.\nThe virus can cause severe illness in some patients, the agency said, adding that it does not “transmit readily” between people. Earlier statements from the Wuhan Municipal Health Authority said there has been no person-to-person spread—a claim disease experts say is impossible to make at this stage in the exploration of a new disease.\n“I don’t know how you know that at all,” said Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus expert Maryland School of Medicine. He noted the number of cases reported makes it seem unlikely that animal-to-human transmission is the only way this virus spread.\nThe WHO said that as authorities home in on the cause—and develop better detection tools — the number of cases associated with this outbreak may rise.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent out an alert to health care providers — a Health Alert Network or HAN — notifying them of the outbreak and urging them to ask patients with severe respiratory infections if they had traveled recently to Wuhan, which is 700 miles south of Beijing.\nThe fact that a coronavirus may be responsible will come as no surprise to the infectious diseases experts who have been watching the situation unfold. The type of illness and the fact that it is emerging in China — where a number of SARS-like and other coronaviruses have been isolated from bats—has pointed in that direction.\nExperts said it will now be important for China to share more information, including enough of a genetic sequence so that health facilities outside of China know what to look for when faced with a pneumonia case with a recent travel history to Wuhan.\nAs it currently stands, Hong Kong is isolating any such cases until they can be tested for influenza, rhinoviruses, and other viruses that cause colds and flu. Given it is flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, telling countries to be on the look out for travelers with fevers and cold-like symptoms casts a very broad net.\n“It really behooves them to at least provide enough information to allow the global community to be ready to do testing,” said Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert North Carolina. “Otherwise you’re just doing screening for fever — in the middle of respiratory disease season? Financial nightmare.”\nIt will also be critical to figure out how the virus transmitted to people. The outbreak has been linked to a large seafood market that also sells live exotic animals for consumption. The market was closed and decontaminated on Jan. 1.\nBaric said investigations will be underway to identify which species—singular or plural—was infected in the market.\n“Understanding the reservoir is critical for eliminating that whole aspect of animal-to-human jump,” Frieman said.\nIdentifying the reservoir of the virus will also require tracing the animals suspected of being infected back to their suppliers so that it can be determined whether other markets might also have received infected animals.\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak—in which more than 8,000 people were infected and nearly 800 died—the source of the virus was traced to palm civets that are eaten as a delicacy in parts of China. The Chinese government ordered a mass culling of the animals as part of its effort to stop the outbreak.\nNews of the pneumonia cases first emerged on Dec. 30, when the local health authority told hospitals to be on the lookout for cases. The next day Chinese authorities informed the WHO that they were dealing with what looked like an outbreak caused by an unknown virus.\nIn its most recent update, the Wuhan Municipal Health Authority said there had been 59 cases, seven of which were in critical condition. The statement said the first known case began showing signs of illness on Dec. 12 and the last case of illness onset was Dec. 29.\nRepublished with permission from STAT .

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\nYanan Wang, The Associated Press Latest Traffic & Weather", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/680NEWStraffic", "https://www.twitter.com/680NEWStraffic"], "published": "2020-01-09T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T11:25:50.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said in a statement, adding that it “demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.”\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.

A preliminary investigation into viral pneumonia illnesses sickening dozens of people in and around China has identified the possible cause as a new type of coronavirus, state media said Thursday, Jan. 9, 2020. In Hong Kong, 15 patients with symptoms of respiratory illness were being treated as of Sunday.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\n___\nStobbe reported from New York.

(AP Photo)\nA cluster of more than 50 pneumonia cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan may be due to a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly SARS and MERS outbreaks, World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. While the United Nations health agency said it needed more comprehensive information to confirm precisely the type of pathogen causing the infections, it said a new coronavirus was a possibility.\nBut on Thursday, Chinese state television was more conclusive, citing pathogen test results from a preliminary assessment expert group.\n“As of January 7, 2020, the laboratory detected a new type of coronavirus,” China Central Television (CCTV) said in a report. “The new coronavirus that caused this epidemic situation is different from previously discovered human coronaviruses, and further understanding of the virus requires more scientific research.”\nThe CCTV report did not identify the laboratory or the expert group.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Some of the virus types cause less severe disease, while some – like the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) – are far more severe.\n“The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan…pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster,” the WHO said in a statement. It added that since Chinese authorities have conducted laboratory tests and eliminated the SARS coronavirus and the MERS one as possible causes, as well as flu, bird flu, adenovirus, and other common respiratory pathogens, “therefore, a novel coronavirus could not be ruled out”.\nThe pneumonia outbreak started last month, and 59 cases had been reported by Chinese authorities by Sunday. The WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically – including in 2002 to cause SARS and in 2012 to cause MERS.\nIt said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person. “More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of the infection, and the countermeasures implemented,” the WHO said.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.

According to a report by China Central Television (CCTV), scientists working on identifying the pathogen behind the disease have stumbled upon a new Coronavirus, a type that has never been before. Thereby, eliminating the much-discussed possibility: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nA Coronavirus belongs to a group of viruses that can cause simple infections such as common cold, or infection of the sinus, and throat, among others. Most of them are considered not to be very lethal. However, some coronavirus can cause life-threatening diseases such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ). According to the WHO, as of September 2019, there have been 2468 confirmed cases across the world, with 851 related deaths. The SARS outbreak in 2003 claimed 774 lives and infected 8,098 worldwide.\nNew coronavirus The report by CCTV said, \"The new coronavirus that caused this epidemic situation is different from previously discovered human coronaviruses, and further understanding of the virus requires more scientific research.\"\nRepresentational Picture Pixabay It was found in around 15 patients from Wuhan City, who were diagnosed with the lung infection. The report also stated that the scientists have obtained the genome sequence of the virus, and under an electron microscope, appeared to be a typical coronavirus.\nAs reported by CNBC , WHO in a statement said, \"The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan...pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster.\" It also said that the Chinese scientists have ruled out SARS and MERS coronavirus, along with a few other possible causes.\nOutbreak in Wuhan Last month , Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee said in a statement that as of December 31, 2019, there have been 27 confirmed cases of pneumonia in the city. Of the 27 cases, seven were said to be in critical condition. While two patients were recovering and are expected to be released soon. However, as of 5 January 2019, there have been 59 reported cases of the mystery illness.

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T11:33:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said in a statement, adding that it “demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.”\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries.

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\nYanan Wang, The Associated Press Join the conversation", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T12:16:25.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

It was closed on January 1.\nThe man, who also had underlying health issues including chronic liver disease, died in hospital on Thursday of “respiratory failure and severe pneumonia”, the commission added.\nNo new cases have been detected since January 3 nor any “clear evidence of human-to-human transmission”, it said.\nPeople in white hazmat suits were seen spraying liquid on the market floor late Saturday, while a number of guards sat outside the perimeter of the facility´s two sections without masks on.\nChinese scientists investigating the outbreak said last week they believe the pathogen is a previously unknown type of coronavirus, a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS.\nScientists in Hong Kong´s Department of Health said Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus found in one of the Wuhan patients and published online by a Chinese expert indicated it was 80 percent similar to SARS found in bats.\nSpeaking at a news conference in Hong Kong, they said it was too early to conclude definitively that it was a SARS strain, adding that the city needed to stay vigilant.\n“We will remain alert as we believe the epidemic will continue to develop,” said Wong Ka-hing, director of the department´s Health Protection Centre.\nHong Kong authorities have taken a range of precautions including stepping up the disinfection of trains and planes, and checks of passengers.\n– Travel rush looms –\nOn Saturday evening, there was little sign of alarm in Wuhan outside of the seafood market, which had been cordoned off.\nFew people at the city´s airport wore masks, and no extra monitoring measures were visible at the airport´s terminals.\nA restaurant on the outside of the building housing the seafood market was still open for business.\nOne man, a dry goods seller at the market surnamed Dai, attempted to enter the market around midnight but was turned away by the guards.\nHe told AFP he was not worried about getting infected.\n“I haven´t heard that this disease is contagious,” Dai said, adding that he believed the illness was caused by a fire at the market in mid-November where items including plastic materials and chili peppers were burnt.\nThe WHO said Thursday it was not recommending any specific measures for travellers or restrictions on trade with China, and expressed confidence in the ability of Chinese authorities to contain the virus.\nChina has entered its annual Lunar New Year holiday travel rush, raising concerns about the mass movement of people serving as a vector for the pathogen.\nIn the world´s largest annual human migration, hundreds of millions will pack into trains, buses and planes to travel for the festival in late January.\nChina has not announced any travel restrictions.\nHong Kong authorities said on Saturday that the number of people hospitalised with flu-like symptoms in recent days after travelling to Wuhan had grown to 60, including seven new cases since Friday.\nForty-six of that total, however, have already been discharged. None have yet been diagnosed with the new coronavirus.\nCity residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week, while officials in Taiwan have urged the island´s health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls.

Jan 9, 2020 5:57 AM By: Canadian Press Updated Jan 9, 2020 6:06 AM\nBEIJING — Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it's possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\nYanan Wang, The Associated Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T14:26:58.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

All received treatment in quarantine.\nEight patients have recovered and were discharged from hospital on Wednesday, according to Xinhua.\nThe commission said the infection broke out between December 12 and 29, with some of the patients employed at a city seafood market since closed for disinfection.\nNo obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission has been reported so far.\nFootage from January 1 by state broadcaster CCTV showed an official notice at the market saying it had been closed in light of the \"current pneumonia situation in our city\", without providing a date for reopening.\nThe outbreak comes just a few weeks before China's busiest annual travel period, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Lunar New Year.\nA Chinese transport ministry official said at a briefing that arrangements were made for \"disinfection, monitoring and prevention\" focusing on areas with large numbers of passengers, including stations and cargo hubs. The infection was first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of over 11 million Photo: AFP / STR\nCivil aviation and national railway authorities said they had not received any reports of affected patients taking flights or trains, and that they were closely watching the situation.\nWan Xiangdong, chief flight officer of China's Civil Aviation Administration, said all planes were equipped with emergency medical kits.\nWHO representative Galea said \"people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports\".\nThe organisation has not recommended any travel restrictions on China.\nIn Hong Kong, hospitals have raised their alert level to \"serious\" and stepped up detection measures -- including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers.\nAuthorities in the financial hub say 38 people have been hospitalised in recent days after returning from Wuhan and displaying flu-like illnesses, but none were confirmed to have contracted the mystery virus.\nSome 21 of the 38 patients had been discharged by Wednesday.\nCity residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week.\nInbound trains and flights from the mainland are undergoing extra cleaning and disinfection, authorities said.\nAdditional thermal imaging systems have been set up at the city's airport, while inbound high-speed rail passengers from the mainland face checks by hand-held infrared thermometers.\nThe coming holiday has prompted concerns in Taiwan, where top officials urged the island's health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls at airports.\nOn Monday, the country's centre for disease control also advised residents planning to travel to or near Wuhan to wear masks and avoid contact with wild animals.\nThe US embassy in China warned on Tuesday that Americans travelling in the country should avoid animals and contact with sick people.\nCopyright AFP.

Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T11:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T13:19:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n\"The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" the ministry's chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n\"In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,\" Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travellers to Wuhan.

Vaccinate against scour\nCalf rearing on farms can be very labour intensive, particularity if there is a scour outbreak. Rotavirus is the most common cause of calf scour, which usually affects calves when they are between five and 14 days old. Also Read: Should I vaccinate my suckler cows against calf scour?\nWhere it is an issue, or if there is a risk of it becoming an issue, a one-shot vaccine can be given between three and 12 weeks before calving, which ensures that the cow’s colostrum contains antibodies that protect against three of the main causes of scour – rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli. Take soil samples\nNow is an ideal time to take soil samples. Anyone who doesn’t have a set of up-to-date soil samples should be taking samples presently or in the near future.\nIt is important to note that soil tests should be no greater than five-years old. Some farmers will take samples more regularly than this, but all should aim to take samples every three-to-five years. Advertisement\nOnce soil sample results are returned, a fertiliser plan for the coming year can be drawn up. This will take the guesswork out of the amount or type of fertiliser to purchase in the spring. Get calving season ready\nThere is not long left until calving season kicks off on many spring-calving dairy farms; so it is time to get your ducks in a row.\nBy now, all calving and calf sheds should be cleaned out and disinfected with any necessary adjustments to sheds made.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Over the course of nearly four years, my team and I visited scores of educational institutions across the country to talk about India’s economic issues and the Economic Surveys.\nEach time, I was struck by the students’ curiosity, enthusiasm and eagerness to learn. In campus after campus, turnout exceeded our expectations, questions exceeded the time to answer them, and we always left wanting to return. Indeed, it was the students’ evident desire to learn, so that they could participate in the national project of building India, which inspired my team and me to create an online course on the Indian economy.\nAmong the campuses we visited were places that have been in the news recently: Jamia Millia University, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), all bastions of youthful idealism. I remember in particular the welcome by the students in AMU — a rousing Jana Gana Mana, with the boys all dressed in black sherwanis and the girls in white salwar-kameezes with red dupattas.\nOpinion | PB Mehta writes: JNU violence reflects an apocalyptic politics driven by a constant need to find new enemies\nBut something has changed over the past few months. Thugs armed not just with weapons but with ideological hate have perpetrated unprovoked violence, not only in these universities but in campuses across India. Among the many victims could easily have been some of the students we met and still remember: The eager escort, the enthusiastic guide, the brilliant questioner, the impressive organiser, the selfie-seeker.\nWe speak of creating a $5-trillion economy by taking advantage of our demographic dividend. But if our universities become war zones rather than sacred sanctuaries of learning, we don’t build human capital. We make carcasses of the hopes of our students. Just as the psychological burdens of poverty and hardship narrow cognitive bandwidth (according to research by Sendhil Mullainathan and Anandi Mani), the psychological burdens of violence on students could impair their capabilities and turn the demographic dividend into a demographic wasteland. Indeed, since building human capital, maintaining social peace and creating strong institutions are key determinants of long-run development, recent actions triply undermine achieving sabka saath, sabka vikas.\nExpress Editorial | Power to the goon: The mob violence on JNU students is a chronicle foretold\nIt is bad enough that our higher education system has routinely been failing our youth. It is bad enough too that their prospects of getting decent, well-paying jobs are becoming more grim. To heap violence and physical and psychological insecurity only adds more hopelessness to their educational years and to their sense of the future that awaits them.\nAnd why are these students being attacked? For exercising their right of expression, their right to articulate their concerns and opinions about a set of measures they fear might consign many Indians to second-class citizenship, if not deprive them of their identity altogether? Are their fears exaggerated or misplaced? Regardless, they must be heard. How else will we be able to understand and address their concerns? And to be clear, address them we must.\nAs the images of violence on India’s university campuses have streamed on screens and phones across the globe over the past months, the poet Yeats’ dark evocation keeps coming to mind: “The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere/The ceremony of innocence is drowned.” So, too, does a climactic scene from Mira Nair’s movie, Monsoon Wedding. The character played by Naseeruddin Shah confronts a relative who has abused a younger family member, saying: “These are my children. I will protect them from myself even, if I have to.” We too must ask: Aren’t these our children, who need to be protected from ourselves, from our instincts to hate and harm? These young, our college students, need to be nurtured, educated, and equipped to build the wealth and future that we want for our country.\nThis article first appeared in the print edition on January 11, 2020 under the title ‘Demographic dividend to demographic wasteland’.

"text": "Advertising Read more Wuhan (China) (AFP)\nWuhan, the Chinese city known as the home of a new virus that has sickened dozens, killed one man and sparked international concern, is not an obvious holiday destination.\nBut Tian, a tourist from another metropolis around three hours' drive away, decided to make the trip despite trepidation from his family over reports of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak.\n\"I said I should be fine, so I came,\" he told AFP after checking out of his hotel on Sunday, wearing a face mask as a precaution nonetheless.\nResidents of the central city seem just as unconcerned about the disease, believed to be from the same family as SARS -- an infectious coronavirus that killed hundreds of people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.\nSo far 41 people with pneumonia-like symptoms have been diagnosed with the new virus in Wuhan, with authorities disclosing on Saturday the death of a 61-year-old man two days earlier.\nThe outbreak began just weeks before China's busiest annual travel period, and national plane and rail authorities are closely watching developments as millions prepare to visit family at Lunar New Year.\nNo clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has yet been detected, according to the local health commission.\nHuanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city centre -- where multiple pneumonia patients worked -- is still cordoned off after being shut down on January 1.\nBut multiple restaurants sharing the same building were open and serving customers early Sunday morning.\nInitial reports about the virus had raised fears that SARS was back, prompting authorities to punish eight people for posting false information online.\nWhile the outbreak sparked a run on face masks at pharmacies in Hong Kong, where scientists urged people to stay vigilant, few on the streets of central Wuhan were sporting masks this weekend.\nMost of the guards stationed around the seafood market were not wearing protective gear, although one group of security staff who had entered the market area wore masks and hats and were instructed at a morning briefing to stay covered at all times.\nMultiple people without safety equipment were seen exiting and entering the market, however, while some guards appeared more concerned about the spread of unflattering images than contagion.\nOne of them threatened to track down AFP reporters for filming a confrontation between the guards and an elderly man who wanted to enter the market.\nThe same guard said merchants had been allowed to enter the facility to check on their stalls, accompanied by security staff.\n-'Nothing you can do'-\nChinese scientists said last week they believe the pathogen is a previously unknown type of coronavirus -- a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS.\nHong Kong's Department of Health said Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus found in one of the Wuhan patients indicated it was 80 percent similar to SARS found in bats.\nBut they said it was too soon to conclude that it was a SARS strain.\nOutside the medical centre in Wuhan where the infected are being treated, patients discharged after being seen for other illnesses waited for buses and taxis, some without face masks.\nVisitors were free to enter and exit the hospital compound, although a guard physically blocked AFP from filming a group of patients moving between buildings, saying it was a \"sensitive\" scene.\nTwo women surnamed Yan and Shu who had been discharged said on Sunday that hospital authorities had pushed overnight for as many patients unrelated to the pneumonia outbreak to be sent home as possible.\n\"Most of the building is empty,\" Shu said, adding that she believed more pneumonia patients would soon be transferred there.\nAnother woman surnamed Yan, waiting for a bus near the hospital with her husband and three-year-old daughter, said she was concerned about the virus but felt there was little point in worrying.\n\"If the illness looks for us, there's nothing we can do,\" she said.\nHer husband Cao said most of their neighbours in the Wuchang district across the river from Huanan market were \"not worried\", as they rarely crossed over to the other side of the city.\n© 2020 AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-12T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled":

A top official at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told state news agency Xinhua on Thursday that laboratory tests had identified the new virus and the whole genome sequence had been obtained. Fifteen patients in Wuhan, Hubei province, had tested positive for the virus, which showed “typical coronavirus morphology”, according to Xu Jianguo, director of the CDC’s National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, who headed a group of experts to identify the illness. “The pathogen of these unexplained cases of viral pneumonia was initially identified as a new type of coronavirus,” he said, adding that initial identification needed to be followed up with further research. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause diseases varying in severity from the common cold to the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). Of the six previously known human coronaviruses, four were common and caused only minor respiratory symptoms similar to those of a cold. The other two are Sars, which killed more than 700 people worldwide after originating in China, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which has killed more than 850 around the world since 2012. Dr Gauden Galea, the World Health Organisation (WHO) representative to China, described the preliminary identification of the new coronavirus in a short period of time as “a notable achievement” that would help authorities in other countries to detect and respond to outbreaks. But he called for more comprehensive information to understand what triggered the outbreak and how to manage it in the coming weeks. “Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented,” Galea said. He said the WHO would continue to monitor the situation closely and was ready to provide technical support to China to investigate and respond to the outbreak. Chinese worker in South Korea diagnosed with pneumonia after visiting Wuhan 9 Jan 2020 Lu Hongzhou, an epidemiologist at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, which helped to identify the coronavirus, said that although scientists were on alert for any mutations, the public had no cause to panic. “The virus appears not to be highly pathogenic or contagious. There have been no fatalities and no cases of medical staff becoming infected,” he said. But identifying the virus was only the first step and a huge amount of work was still needed to trace its source, he said. “The CDC has been working on it and any cases that are related to the Wuhan outbreak will be reported,” Lu said. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said a number of important details needed to be established. “Some key information, including which animal is the source of the virus, the incubation period and the transmission route, is still missing,” he said. Medical authorities in Wuhan had earlier ruled out Sars, Mers and bird flu as causes of the outbreak. Sars killed hundreds of people in mainland China and Hong Kong, but no deaths have been reported in Wuhan and eight patients, no longer showing pneumonia symptoms, had been discharged from hospital by Wednesday. The Wuhan health authority has said that no human-to-human transmission has so far been detected. There have been 59 reported cases of the mystery virus in Wuhan since last month, many of them involving individuals who worked in a seafood market where wild animals such as pheasants and snakes, as well as rabbit organs, had also been sold. The market has since been closed. Coronaviruses can infect mammals such as pigs, cattle, cats, dogs, camels, bats and mice, as well as humans. The Sars virus probably infected humans after jumping from animals, according to the World Health Organisation . China pneumonia outbreak raises spectre of Sars as infections jump to 44 7 Jan 2020 Dr Ho Pak-leung, an infectious disease expert from the University of Hong Kong, said that one area of focus for the investigation should be the supply chain of animals sold in the market, because coronaviruses carried by mammals and some birds could mix, mutate and jump from animals to humans. If the virus came from that supply chain, animals carrying the coronavirus could have reached other locations too, Ho said. “It would be necessary to check the supply chain as soon as possible, and see whether similar [animals] were supplied in other wet markets outside Wuhan,” he said. The health authority in Wuhan was still assessing the seafood market and tracing people who had been in close contact with those infected. The city’s first case was identified on December 12 and the latest on December 29. CDC official Xu said the laboratory had used genomic sequencing, nucleic acid detection, virus isolation and other methods to analyse samples from patients. Although it is possible to find evidence of a pathogen in a short period of time, it could take years to produce a vaccine. The identification of the new virus came just a day before the Lunar New Year travel rush. Photo: Simon Song The new virus’ identification came a day before Chinese people began travelling in their hundreds of millions for the Lunar New Year holiday, during which 3 billion journeys are expected to be made in about 40 days. Neither the country’s civil aviation authority nor its railway authority has reported any unexplained pneumonia cases, but the transport authority said it would monitor the situation closely and take measures to contain any spread of the virus during the busy travelling season. “The emergence of the epidemic may cause everyone to worry about travelling during the Spring Festival, especially in areas with concentrated passenger traffic,” Wang Yang, the Ministry of Transport’s chief engineer, said. “Arrangements and deployments have been made to focus on disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passengers, including transport hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub factories.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-10T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T14:20:52.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

(Images By Tang Ming Tung/Getty Images) That Mystery Disease Outbreak in China Could Be Caused by a Newly Discovered Virus JING XUAN TENG & YAN ZHAO, AFP 9 JAN 2020\nChina believes a mysterious pneumonia outbreak that struck 59 people is caused by a new strain of virus from the same family as SARS, which killed hundreds of people more than a decade ago.\nLead scientist Xu Jianguo told the official Xinhua news agency that experts had \"preliminarily determined\" a new type of coronavirus was behind the outbreak, first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of more than 11 million.\nIt initially sparked fears of a resurgence of highly contagious Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and prompted authorities in Hong Kong - badly hit by SARS in 2002-2003 - to take precautions, including stepping up the disinfection of trains and airplanes, and checks of passengers.\nChina has since ruled out a fresh outbreak of SARS, which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong.\n\"A total of 15 positive results of the new type of coronavirus had been detected\" in the lab, through tests on infected blood samples and throat swabs, Xu said.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the preliminary discovery of a new coronavirus in a statement .\n\"Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO Representative to China.\nWuhan's health commission said on Sunday seven of the 59 patients were seriously ill, but none had died. All received treatment in quarantine.\nEight patients have recovered and were discharged from hospital on Wednesday, according to Xinhua.\nThe commission said the infection broke out between December 12 and 29, with some of the patients employed at a city seafood market since closed for disinfection.\nNo obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission has been reported so far.\nFootage from January 1 by state broadcaster CCTV showed an official notice at the market saying it had been closed in light of the \"current pneumonia situation in our city\", without providing a date for reopening.\nThe outbreak comes just a few weeks before China's busiest annual travel period, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Lunar New Year.\nA Chinese transport ministry official said at a briefing that arrangements were made for \"disinfection, monitoring and prevention\" focusing on areas with large numbers of passengers, including stations and cargo hubs.\nCivil aviation and national railway authorities said they had not received any reports of affected patients taking flights or trains, and that they were closely watching the situation.\nWan Xiangdong, chief flight officer of China's Civil Aviation Administration, said all planes were equipped with emergency medical kits.\nWHO representative Galea said \"people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports\".\nThe organisation has not recommended any travel restrictions on China. Hong Kong, Taiwan fears\nIn Hong Kong, hospitals have raised their alert level to \"serious\" and stepped up detection measures - including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers.\nAuthorities in the financial hub say 48 people have been hospitalised in recent days after returning from Wuhan and displaying flu-like illnesses, but none were confirmed to have contracted the mystery virus.\nTwenty-five of the patients have been discharged, Hong Kong authorities said Thursday.\nCity residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week.\nInbound trains and flights from the mainland are undergoing extra cleaning and disinfection, authorities said.\nAdditional thermal imaging systems have been set up at the city's airport, while inbound high-speed rail passengers from the mainland face checks by hand-held infrared thermometers.\nThe coming holiday has prompted concerns in Taiwan, where top officials urged the island's health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls at airports.\nOn Monday, the country's centre for disease control also advised residents planning to travel to or near Wuhan to wear masks and avoid contact with wild animals.\nThe US embassy in China warned on Tuesday that Americans travelling in the country should avoid animals and contact with sick people.", "external_links": ["https://who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china", "https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china"], "published": "2020-01-09T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T02:40:29.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

As you can see from the information provided, the number of confirmed cases is now down to 41 given the novel corona virus confirmation. Secondly, according to the information, Wuhan authorities and the health departments are doing a lot of work currently in terms of trying to get more epidemiological information, public health surveillance as well as treating the cases in the hospital. Of note is that there are still some serious cases, but there are also some that have already been discharged from hospital. According to Mainland authorities, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and there are also no healthcare professionals infected. I think this is the information that we have collected so far. And also of note is after the closure of the concerned market in Wuhan, there are no new cases since January 3. I think this is important epidemiological information for us to use for further assessment. Also, I will be chairing a meeting later on after this interview. We are also trying to invite experts. I will be receiving reports from the Centre for Health Protection and also the Hospital Authority in terms of the latest assessment and whether there is any updated information. The Government has always been very active and proactive in terms of getting information. We have an existing mechanism of communication. Regarding this, the Government has always been proactive in trying to get information and having communication with Mainland authorities. In terms of getting the genome sequencing, we have already requested it and we are waiting for the reply from Mainland authorities. An important point to note is that according to our infection control experts, right now with our laboratory competence, we can also test given the information of the novel corona virus, but it takes a slightly longer time. If we can get the whole genome sequencing, obviously the time can be cut shorter. So, it is not something we can't do but we are, at the same time, trying to get information in terms of preparing and also controlling any public health infectious disease issues.\nSecretary for Food & Health Prof Sophia Chan today said she will chair a meeting and invite experts to discuss the latest developments of pneumonia cases detected in Wuhan.\nSpeaking to the media after a radio programme this morning, Prof Chan said the Food & Health Bureau received new information from Mainland authorities, noting that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that no healthcare professionals have been infected.\nThere are no new cases since January 3, she added.\nProf Chan explained that Wuhan authorities and the health department are doing a lot of work in terms of obtaining more epidemiological information, public health surveillance as well as treating patients in the hospital.\nShe asserted the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has always been proactive in getting information from Mainland authorities through the existing mechanism of communication.\n“In terms of getting the genome sequence, we have already requested it and we are waiting for the reply from Mainland authorities.\n“An important point to note is that according to our infection control experts, right now with our laboratory competence, we can also test given the information of the novel corona virus, but it takes a slightly longer time.\n“If we can get the whole genome sequence, obviously the time can be cut shorter.”\nProf Chan added that she will chair a meeting to discuss the situation later.\n“We are also trying to invite experts.

Hong Kong is set to race against time to develop diagnostic tests for the mystery strain of pneumonia that has claimed its first fatality on the mainland, after the city obtains the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus from Chinese authorities. A team of Hong Kong experts, meanwhile, will on Monday fly to Wuhan – ground zero of the outbreak – in Hubei province to meet health officials there and get first-hand information on the disease and control measures implemented. The latest development came as Hong Kong’s public hospitals reported seven more suspected cases. The seven comprised two boys aged eight and 13, a 10-year-old girl, a man and three women, aged 38 to 67. All had been to the mainland city in the past two weeks and developed fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms. None of them had visited wet markets there. The patients were sent to six hospitals – Queen Elizabeth, United Christian, Queen Mary, Eastern, Tuen Mun, and Prince of Wales. The Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong confirmed on Sunday that it had received notification from China’s National Health Commission that it had shared with the World Health Organisation the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus. “The relevant institutions have also uploaded the genetic sequence onto the online GenBank (GISAID). GISAID is cross-checking the information and will publish it upon completion,” the centre said in a statement. “The [centre’s] Public Health Laboratory Services Branch … as one of the users of this GenBank, will obtain the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus. While [the branch] is conducting molecular testing for a number of coronaviruses, it will develop specific tests based on the information of the new sequence,” the centre added. Wuhan pneumonia ‘bears close similarity to Sars’, analysis finds Genome sequencing of viruses is a useful tool for better understanding of the nature of diseases caused and for surveillance of the strain. The technology allows the development of specific diagnostic kits that can quickly identify illnesses and relevant care for patients, ensuring better containment of an outbreak. The centre pledged to maintain close liaison with the National Health Commission and WHO and closely monitor the latest development of cases in Wuhan. A group of Hong Kong experts, led by undersecretary for food and health Dr Chui Tak-yi, will leave for Wuhan on Monday. During their two-day visit, the team is expected to be briefed on the latest situation and control measures, as well as on clinical management. Also part of the group is Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch of the Centre for Health Protection, and Dr Raymond Lai Wai-man, chief infection control officer at the Hospital Authority. Since December 31, the authority has reported 67 suspected cases with no confirmed infection of the Wuhan strain thus far. Among these, 51 have been discharged and those still in hospitals are in stable condition. Chinese scientists investigating the outbreak said last week they believed the pathogen was a previously unknown type of coronavirus, linked to the family under which the acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, is also classified. The primary source for the Wuhan virus was believed to be bats, as with Sars, which passed it to game animals consumed by humans. On Saturday a 61-year-old man became the first patient to die from the new strain, among the 41 cases diagnosed in the mainland city, according to health authorities there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-12T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-12T22:54:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan's outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever.

Six more people have been admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong after developing respiratory symptoms on their return from the mainland Chinese city of Wuhan, health authorities said on Friday. It brought the number of suspected cases in the city to 54. A new coronavirus strain was revealed by mainland health authorities on Thursday to be the cause of the mystery pneumonia outbreak in the central Chinese city, where 59 people have been infected since December. In Hong Kong, six more people who recently returned from Wuhan showed either symptoms of fever and respiratory infection or pneumonia. The new cases – reported between Thursday noon and midday on Friday – included two three-year-old girls and a four-year-old boy. Four were already found to be infected with flu or other known viruses. So far, 31 of the 54 suspected cases in the city have already been discharged. Hu Ke, a respiratory medicine professor from Hubei General Hospital who had treated patients in Wuhan, told mainland Chinese media on Friday that most patients’ conditions were “mild to moderate”. “Conditions of patients in general come under control after treatment,” Hu said, adding that most patients who were still in hospital remained stable. He said that more than 90 per cent of the patients had a fever at the early stage of the disease, and around 15 per cent had difficulty breathing. Infectious diseases expert Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, from the University of Hong Kong, predicted that the risk of the disease spreading from Wuhan – one of mainland China’s largest transport hubs – during the Lunar New Year’s mass movement of people would be small. This year’s migration began on Friday, two weeks ahead of the festival at the end of January. Yuen’s prediction was based on information released by the mainland that no evidence had been found of a human to human transmission. “Avian flu, 99 per cent of the time, is transmitted to humans from live birds at markets,” Yuen told a radio programme on Friday morning. He said if the transmission route of the Wuhan virus was the same as avian flu, the risk of transmission should be “low”. Yuen added that the genetic information of the virus, which the mainland authorities said on Thursday that they had obtained, could allow Hong Kong experts to develop a quick test that could diagnose the virus in two to three hours, much shorter than the current method that takes six to eight hours. The Centre for Health Protection said it was still waiting for a reply from the National Health Commission after asking for virus information, including its genetic sequence. “We have to accept that the genetic information belongs to [the mainland], when they provide it to us is their decision,” he said. Speaking on the same radio programme, microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung reiterated that tracing the source of the unknown Wuhan virus was crucial to understand the features of the virus. Ho also said mainland Chinese authorities must thoroughly improve sanitation at wet markets or risk similar coronaviruses spreading in Wuhan and other parts of China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-10T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T16:48:45.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Advertisement\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it’s possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.

The seafood market in Wuhan – a major domestic and international transport hub – is now closed and no cases have been reported elsewhere in China or internationally, it said.\n“The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan,” the WHO statement said, adding that the market was closed on January 1. “At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission.”\nThe WHO said last week that a newly emerging member of the ‘coronavirus’ family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks was the likely cause of the outbreak.\nCoronaviruses can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some types cause less serious disease, while others can be far more severe.\nAmong 41 people confirmed as infected with the new viral pneumonia, one – a 61-year-old man with serious underlying medical conditions – died last week. Seven others are in critical condition, the Wuhan health authorities said on Saturday.\nThe WHO said preliminary epidemiological investigations had found most cases were in people who either worked at or were frequent visitors to Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\n“To date, investigations are still under way to assess the full extent of the outbreak,” it added. 2020,08:01PM at 8:01 Sci-tech , Homepage Latest Stories Slider ", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-12T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-13T05:17:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

According to Thai authorities, the patient is recovering from the illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, infecting dozens of people in China and, on Saturday, Chinese media reported the first known death from the virus.\nCoronaviruses rely on animal to human transmission, and the health commission in Wuhan has reportedly declared that there is no evidence of any spread between humans.\nHowever, given recent developments, WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is planning to consult with the members of the agency’s Emergency Committee, and could call for a meeting of the Committee at short notice.\nIn its Monday statement, WHO noted that it has been expecting cases to be reported in countries other than China, underscoring the importance of monitoring and preparedness in other countries. The work of WHO and the Chinese authorities in containing the new coronavirus will be made more complicated by the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, which begins on January 25, and sees hundreds of millions criss-crossing the country.\nWHO has issued guidance on how to detect and treat persons ill with the new virus: standard recommendations for halting the spread of coronaviruses include regular hand washing; covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing; thoroughly cooking meat and eggs; and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing.\nWhat is a coronavirus?\nCoronaviruses are described by WHO as “a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases”. Probably the best known is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, commonly known as SARS, which broke out in Asia in 2003, and spread to countries in North America, South America and Europe, before being successfully contained later that year.\nCoronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and there are several known coronaviruses currently circulating in animals, that have not yet infected humans.\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nPhoto caption and credit: US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases The MERS coronavirus, digitally imaged.

The incident occurred about 10:30am on the Pattaya-bound side of the road. The driver, 53 year old Thanakorn To-iam, said he picked up the passengers at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok and was taking them to Pattaya when the van’s left rear tyre burst, causing it to swerve and hit the railing of the median.\nAll eight of the tourists received first aid at the scene before being taken to Bangkok Pattaya Hospital.\nPolice are investigating. 61 year old Chinese tourist being treated for new coronavirus in Thailand\nPublished Greeley Pulitzer PHOTO: Pornprom Satrabhaya\nA 61 year old Chinese tourist, found to be infected with the new strain of coronavirus dubbed “Wuhan or Chinese pneumonia” when she arrived in Thailand last week, is being treated in hospital and is expected to be discharged in a few days. This is from the Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul. The woman is recovering at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi province, about 12 kilometres outside of Bangkok.\n“She is now showing few fever or respiratory symptoms, and if doctors give her a clearance she could be allowed to go home in as little as a few days. She was the first person detected with the virus outside of China and her rapid diagnosis and successful treatment show the efficiency and effectiveness of Thailand’s health services.”\nSixteen people who shared the flight with the woman were also examined, all with negative results, although some exhibited slight flu-like symptoms.\nSince January 3, a total of 12 passengers arriving from from Wuhan in China have showed flu-like symptoms which justified their being quarantined. Eight have so far been treated and discharged\nThe Chinese woman was treated in an isolation ward. Her infection with the coronavirus was confirmed on Sunday. The Public Health Ministry had not found anyone else infected with the virus.\n59 people in China have been confirmed infected with the new strain of the coronavirus, which has been linked to a sudden outbreak of pneumonia in central China that has killed one. All had attended markets selling animals and seafood in Wuhan city and were either workers or buyers. There has been no known human-to-human transmission of the virus.\nHuanan Seafood Market, one of Wuhan’s largest meat and seafood markets has been identified as the source of the outbreak and was shut down on Jan. 1. The man who died had recently been a customer.\nCoronaviruses are not necessarily life-threatening but have been the source of several public health crises, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which killed hundreds of people after an outbreak in southern China in 2002 and 2003.\nThe Wuhan viral outbreak appears less virulent and less transmittable, according to the World Health Organisation.", "external_links": ["https://www.mymeditravel.com", "https://dbventures.io/", "https://www.smartjob.id/en", "https://boatcrowd.com/", "https://www.dbventures.io/", "https://www.mymeditravel.com/", "https://fazwazgroup.com/", "https://jobcute.com/en", "https://www.jobcute.com/en", "https://smartjob.id/en", "https://www.fazwazgroup.com/", "https://www.boatcrowd.com/", "https://twitter.com/share?text=First", "https://www.boatcrowd.com", "https://dbventures.io", "https://mymeditravel.com/", "https://www.fazwazgroup.com", "https://twitter.com/share", "https://www.twitter.com/share?text=First"], "published": "2020-01-14T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-14T07:22:39.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It was classically associated with dogs going to kennels and was associated with either a Bordetella bronchiseptica or canine parainfluenza (CPIV) infection. These are the components of what most people consider the “kennel cough” vaccine. However, there are many other infectious causes of a dry, hacking cough. In fact, in different geographic locations, some of the other infectious causes are a lot more common than bordetella or parainfluenza.\nFurthermore, dogs do not get this cough just at boarding kennels. Dogs can pick up an infectious cough just about anywhere they come into contact with other dogs — in animal shelters (especially ones with poor ventilation) and veterinary hospitals and at dog shows, dog parks and the groomer’s. The more accepted name in the veterinary community is now canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD).\nDog health: signs of a healthy dog Causes of upper respiratory tract infections in dogs\nIn addition to bordetella and parainfluenza, causes of an infectious cough in dogs include canine distemper (CDV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine influenza (CIV), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine herpesvirus (CHV), pantropic canine coronavirus, canine reovirus, mycoplasma, and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. The last two, along with bordetella, are bacteria. The others are viruses.\nAny dog exposed to one of these pathogens can be infected. However, a dog is much more likely to be infected in a moist, warm environment with poor ventilation and with repeated exposure, such as in a kennel or a shelter. It is very common for shelters to have to quarantine a whole section once an infectious cough breaks out because it spreads so easily and quickly. Yet, even a simple exposure that occurs during a quick meeting at a dog park is enough to transmit the infection. Mild and severe symptoms of kennel cough\nOnce a dog is exposed, it usually takes two or three days before he starts to show signs, but it can be up to 10 days. The one exception to this is canine distemper. With distemper, it can take up to four weeks before signs are noted. The most common signs are typically mild and include a cough (especially when pressure is applied to the trachea or windpipe), sneezing and eye discharge. The cough can often sound like the dog is retching or it could be described as dry and hacking.\nIn more severe infections, the dog can have a fever and may have trouble breathing. He will not be interested in eating and will appear to be very tired. The more severe signs tend to occur in unvaccinated dogs, dogs with weak immune systems, such as puppies or dogs with other illnesses, and with some of the different pathogens, such as canine influenza virus, canine distemper virus and streptococcus. However, any of the infectious agents can lead to serious signs. It is impossible to know which agent is causing the cough based on clinical signs alone. Canine infectious respiratory disease diagnosis\nMost veterinarians can diagnose CIRD based on clinical signs alone. However, they may take chest radiographs (which is the technical name for X-rays) to make sure that pneumonia is not present, as this circumstance would change the treatment.\nIt is possible to figure out what the underlying cause is, but it’s often not necessary (or worth the expense) for an individual animal unless he does not respond to initial therapy, if there are signs of more aggressive disease, if multiple dogs are coming down with the same signs at the same time, or if there is an outbreak in a shelter or kennel. In the case of a shelter or kennel outbreak, it is important to know the underlying cause because it will dictate what cleaning agents are necessary, how long quarantine should be, and if vaccine recommendations should be changed for that organization.\nTo figure out what the causative agent is, a culture can be taken of the upper airway. However, this typically requires sedation and only covers bacteria; it will not diagnose viruses. In the last five years, it has been more customary to do a swab of the nose and deep throat, and send out for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to look for genetic material of the causative agent. These tests can test for everything, do not require sedation, and are relatively affordable compared to doing other tests for each individual organism. Kennel cough treatment\nThe traditional treatment for a dog with a cough is starting antibiotics. Ideally, the antibiotic chosen is based on culture results, but often an antibiotic such as doxycycline is chosen, as it takes care of the more common bacterial causes of CIRD. There is controversy about when and if to start antibiotics, since most of the causes of CIRD are viruses, and therefore antibiotics do not directly treat them. However, it is not uncommon for secondary bacterial infections to occur, especially in sensitive dogs such as puppies or dogs with weak immune systems. Antibiotics may prevent progression to more serious disease. In many situations, though, cases of CIRD are self-limiting (similar to the common cold in humans) and the symptoms will resolve on their own without treatment.\nMost veterinarians will start antibiotics if the dog has a fever, if he is very lethargic, if there is yellow or green discharge, if the dog is not eating or if the cough is getting worse instead of better after a few days. Antibiotics are also started if a culture dictates that treatment or if the PCR test reveals a more aggressive bacterial infection, such as streptococcus. Streptococcus has a greater likelihood of making a dog very sick and can even result in death. Antibiotics can also shorten the shedding period (the time a dog is contagious to other dogs), so they are often considered in cases in the shelter environment, in order to control the spread to the rest of the population.\nIf the cough is severe enough, a cough suppressant may be prescribed. These medications can make an animal more comfortable, but they can make it harder for him to clear the infection. Coughing is a way to expel mucous and infectious agents, so decreasing the cough can be counter-productive.\nThere is no easy home remedy to cure kennel cough other than time. Most dogs will clear the infection themselves in 10-14 days (with the exception of distemper, which can take weeks or months to clear). As long as the dog is acting fine otherwise and the cough is not worsening, you could wait before doing any treatment. We still recommend taking the dog to a veterinarian, however, to make sure no other interventions are needed first. It can be helpful to nebulize the dog with some sterile saline. A nebulizer can be used for about 10 minutes twice a day to help keep the dog’s airway moist.\nIn addition to clearing the signs of infection, most dogs are not contagious after 10-14 days of being ill, especially if antibiotics are used in bacterial infections. The exception to this, of course, is the canine distemper virus, which can be shed for weeks or months. So, it is important to keep a coughing dog away from other dogs for 10-14 days. Prognosis for dogs with CIRD\nFor most cases of CIRD, the prognosis is very good. Most dogs do not even require treatment and recover on their own within 10 days. If pneumonia is present, much more aggressive therapy is required, but dogs typically recover if this therapy is administered.\nA poorer prognosis occurs with dogs who have concurrent respiratory disease, such as a collapsing trachea or upper airway constrictions. Brachycephalic breeds (short-nosed dogs such as pugs, bulldogs and Boston terriers) with CIRD need to be treated more aggressively because their compromised airway makes them more prone to getting secondary bacterial infections, and they have a harder time clearing the infection.\nAs stated earlier, dogs with weak immune systems also have a more guarded prognosis. Puppies, dogs with immune-mediated disease, dogs on immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone, and dogs with cancer are all more likely to require more intensive therapy and have a poorer prognosis.\nEven though the signs are very similar regardless of the infectious agent involved, which infectious agent can have a significant impact on prognosis. For instance, untreated dogs with Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus can die.\nDogs vaccinated for the CIRD pathogens have a much better prognosis. Vaccination does not completely prevent infection in most cases, but it can dramatically reduce the duration and severity of disease. Prevention of kennel cough with canine vaccinations\nThe easiest form of prevention is vaccination. Vaccines are available for canine distemper, canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus type 2, canine influenza virus and bordetella. Of these, the distemper, parainfluenza and adenovirus vaccines are part of the core vaccines that most veterinarians administer. The bordetella vaccination is typically reserved for dogs at significant risk, such as those who frequent kennels, doggie daycare and the groomer’s. Currently, the canine influenza vaccine is typically done only in areas where there have been significant outbreaks or for dogs who travel a lot and might go to an outbreak area.\nIt is important to remember that the vaccines do not prevent infection or prevent a dog from spreading one of the pathogens. However, vaccines do decrease the duration and severity of illness. The one exception is the canine distemper vaccine, which does actually help prevent a dog from being infected. Because of this, along with the negative characteristics of canine distemper (taking longer to show signs, being shed for a longer period, the possibility of long-term problems and even death), many veterinarians recommend that dogs be vaccinated for distemper at an early age and be given boosters throughout their lives.\nThe fact that most vaccines do not prevent infection is part of the answer to the question of why a dog might still get kennel cough (again, more correctly, CIRD) even though he has been vaccinated with the kennel cough vaccine (which is normally a combination of bordetella and parainfluenza virus). Another part of the answer to that question is the fact that of the 11 common pathogens that cause CIRD, there are vaccines for only five of them. When outbreaks of coughing happen at a kennel, the culprit is usually one of the five that cannot be vaccinated for.\nVaccinations also do not take effect immediately, since it takes time for the dog’s immune system to respond to the vaccine and develop protection. Depending on the pathogen and the vaccine type, this process can take two weeks or longer.\nIt is also important to remember that puppies aren’t considered fully vaccinated until they are at least 4-5 months old. When puppies are born, they acquire some protection from infectious disease from their mother, through maternal antibodies. Over time, maternal antibodies decrease, though the rate is different for each individual (and can even be different for individual puppies in the same litter). Maternal antibodies, however, can interfere with vaccination protection, causing vaccines to be ineffective, even when the protection left from mom isn’t enough to protect the puppy from disease. After about three months of age, maternal antibodies are low enough not to interfere, so a puppy needs at least two vaccines after maternal antibodies have disappeared to be protected.\nThe other part of prevention is avoidance. Especially when there are outbreaks of a cough in an area, you should avoid bringing your dog to places where dogs congregate. In some circumstances, of course, it is not possible to avoid a kennel, the veterinarian’s office or even the groomer’s. When this is the case, it is important to limit the length of a stay and find a kennel with good ventilation and outdoor access. For animals who are prone to more serious illness from CIRD, finding a pet sitter or at-home groomer is the best situation. Again, those more prone to serious illness include puppies, dogs with other diseases (especially respiratory diseases) and short-nosed dogs.\nHow often to vaccinate a dog Additional information on canine distemper\nAs noted previously, the canine distemper virus is one of the possible viral causes of CIRD. There are some very important differences, however, between distemper and the other respiratory pathogens.\nClinical signs of distemper (e.g., a dry, hacking cough) can be identical to those of other causes of CIRD. In about 10% of cases, though, neurological signs (seizures, tremors) can occur. In some cases when neurological signs are present, the dog will recover completely; in other cases, the neurological signs remain for life. In rare cases, a dog will appear to recover from respiratory disease and then will develop neurological signs weeks later.\nDistemper more frequently causes pneumonia than the other causes of CIRD. In addition, distemper infects more than just the respiratory system, so a variety of other signs can occur (neurological, as discussed above, but also urinary symptoms and gastrointestinal signs like vomiting and diarrhea). In young puppies, distemper is frequently associated with a high fatality rate. Most adult dogs, particularly those with partial immunity from a recent vaccination, will survive.\nUnlike most CIRD pathogens, distemper has a longer incubation period — the period between when a dog is exposed to a disease and when he starts to show symptoms. The typical incubation for distemper is 10-14 days, though it can be as long as a month.\nDistemper can also be shed for long periods of time, which means a dog who is no longer showing any symptoms may still be contagious to other unprotected dogs. Shedding typically lasts for about a month, but it can last for several months in some cases. Contagiousness can be monitored by repeating respiratory PCR testing; consecutive negative tests can confirm that a dog is no longer contagious.\nTreatment for distemper is symptomatic, as it is a virus. Antibiotics are often administered to protect against or to treat pneumonia. Anti-convulsants and muscle relaxants may control some of the neurological signs. If gastrointestinal signs are present, medications to help with nausea and diarrhea can be administered. And fluids are often given to the dog to maintain hydration during periods of decreased appetite and vomiting or diarrhea.\nWhile distemper is a more serious cause of CIRD, even dogs with distemper can survive, depending on the dog’s previous vaccinations, age and concurrent illnesses. Distemper is more widespread than many people realize (it’s common in many regions of the southern U.S.), but it is important to keep in mind that it’s not the death sentence we once thought. Though distemper can be very serious or fatal in some cases, many dogs do well and go on to live completely normal, happy lives.

More than 1,160,000 pigs have been rising investments in R&D activities in the development of novel therapeutics, a growing number of governments initiatives for the prevention of zoonotic diseases, increasing demand for livestock products is expected to propel the global swine health market. culled in an effort to halt the further spread. Additionally, the growing consumption of pork globally.\nKey Market Trends\nVaccines are Expected to Lead the Market\nVaccines are comprised of viruses, bacteria or other disease-causing organisms that have been killed or altered. Hence, they cannot cause any disease and boost up immunity. New advanced vaccines have been manufactured, which contains genetically engineered components derived from those disease agents. They are given to pigs, usually by injection, to stimulate an immune response which will protect the pigs against later natural infection with the organism from which the vaccine was derived.\nMost of the vaccines stimulate both a humoral response and a cell-mediated response. Vaccines can be live, containing living organisms which will multiply in the pig, or inactivated, containing only killed organisms which will not multiply in the pig. As there is a need for novel vaccines against all the disease-causing pathogens, there is a rapid increase in the R&D expenditure, which drives the vaccine segment to expand its reach to a broad spectrum of diseases.\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate over the Forecast Period\nNorth America is expected to dominate the market due to the rising incidence of swine infections, such as Swine Enteric Coronavirus Diseases (SECD), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDv), porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), which has caused significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.\nThe virus is endemic in swine populations in North America. In the United States, the Swine Health Protection Act (SHPA) regulates the meat products fed to swine. Compliance with this act ensures that all food waste fed to swine is properly treated to kill disease organisms. Raw meat may transmit numerous infectious or communicable diseases to swine. Over the forecast period, with the rise in the incidence of swine, the US is expected to be a major revenue-generating region for the swine health market.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe market players in the swine health market are involving in various growth strategies such as collaborations, partnerships, agreements, mergers, and acquisitions in order to enhance the market presence. For instance, in 2018 Elanco Animal Health, introduced Prevacent PRRS a modified-live respiratory vaccine for reduction of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), respiratory form, in piglets two weeks or older. In May 2019, MSD Animal Health has launched its Porcilis Ery+Parvo+Lepto combination vaccine for pigs.\nKey Topics Covered\n1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Study Deliverables\n1.2 Study Assumptions\n1.3 Scope of the Study\n2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n4 MARKET DYNAMICS\n4.1 Market Overview\n4.2 Market Drivers\n4.2.1 Increasing Incidence of Swine Diseases\n4.2.2 Increasing Demand for Livestock Products\n4.2.3 Increasing Investments in R&D Activities to Develop Novel Therapeutics\n4.3 Market Restraints\n4.3.1 Regulatory Challenges\n4.3.2 High Cost Associated With Swine Health Especially in the Developing Countries\n4.4 Porter’s Five Force Analysis\n4.4.1 Threat of New Entrants\n4.4.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers/Consumers\n4.4.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers\n4.4.4 Threat of Substitute Products\n4.4.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry\n5 MARKET SEGMENTATION\n5.1 By Products\n5.1.1 Diagnostic Tests\n5.1.1.1 Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA)\n5.1.1.2 Rapid Immuno Migration (RIM)\n5.1.1.3 Agar Gel Immuno-Diffusion (AGID)\n5.1.1.4 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\n5.1.1.5 Diagnostic Imaging\n5.1.2 Therapeutics\n5.1.2.1 Vaccines\n5.1.2.2 Parasiticide\n5.1.2.3 Anti-infective\n5.1.2.4 Feed additives\n5.1.2.5 Antibiotics\n5.1.2.6 Others\n5.2 By Diseases\n5.2.1 Exudative dermatitis (greasy pig disease)\n5.2.2 Coccidiosis\n5.2.3 Respiratory diseases\n5.2.4 Swine dysentery\n5.2.5 Porcine parvovirus\n5.2.6 Others\n5.3 Geography\n5.3.1 North America\n5.3.2 Europe\n5.3.3 Asia-Pacific\n5.3.4 Middle East & Africa\n5.3.5 South America\n6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\n6.1 Company Profiles\n6.1.1 Abaxis\n6.1.2 Bayer Animal Health\n6.1.3 Boehringer Ingelheim\n6.1.4 Ceva Animal Health Inc.\n6.1.5 Elanco\n6.1.6 IDVet\n6.1.7 Merck Animal Health\n6.1.8 Merial\n6.1.9 Vetoquinol S.A.\n6.1.10 Virbac\n6.1.11 Zoetis Animal Healthcare\n7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/shhuje\nResearch and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.\nCONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\n ", "external_links": ["https://researchandmarkets.com/reports/4833390/swine-healthcare-market-growth-trends-and?utm_source=dynamic&utm_medium=GNOM&utm_code=4txfnk&utm_campaign=1327898+-+Global+Swine+Healthcare+Market+by+Products%2c+Diseases+%26+Geography+-+Forecast+to+2024&utm_exec=joca220gnomd", "https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4833390/swine-healthcare-market-growth-trends-and?utm_source=dynamic&utm_medium=GNOM&utm_code=4txfnk&utm_campaign=1327898+-+Global+Swine+Healthcare+Market+by+Products%2c+Diseases+%26+Geography+-+Forecast+to+2024&utm_exec=joca220gnomd", "https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4833390/swine-healthcare-market-growth-trends-and"], "published": "2019-12-04T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-04T15:08:18.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

How prepared are we? What do we need to do to be ready? LANZHOU, CHINA - Woman selling live chickens and ducks in cages at a food market, Gansu province, ... [+] Lanzhou, China (Photo by Eric Lafforgue/Art In All Of Us/Corbis via Getty Images)\nCorbis via Getty Images These are some of the questions faced by global leaders in public health, industry, and government in a pandemic preparedness exercise called Event 201 . The program was a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Trying to improve preparedness is critically important as we will be seeing more epidemics from factors like climate change, shifting and increasing populations, urbanization, deforestation, and globalization.\nThe experts ran through a carefully designed, detailed simulation of a new (fictional) viral illness called CAPS or coronavirus acute pulmonary syndrome. This was modeled after previous epidemics like SARS and MERS.\nWhat follows hasn’t happened yet, but the scenario was quite realistic, presuming that the infection began with animals and then was transmitted to people, just as has happened in past pandemics. There were even prepared “news” clips from a fictional GNN, with health experts and talking heads pontificating, and flashy graphics showing the spread of the pandemic.\nAt various steps, the experts discussed possible interventions and needs—were there adequate supplies of masks, for example? Or medicines? What was the capacity of factories to produce supplies and airlines to distribute them?\nWhile I couldn’t attend the exercise, Event 201 is available to watch and was a worthwhile, if not uplifting, experience. Emily Ricotta, PhD ( @Iplaywithgerms ) also live-tweeted it and her thread can be seen here .\nThe first discussion centered around the distribution of supplies. Without knowing more about the epidemiology and transmission of the new CAPS virus, one can’t plan intelligently. For example, are face masks, or hand sanitizer, or water purification the priority? Surveillance and data collection are spotty as some LMIC (low- and middle-income countries) don’t have the capacity to obtain specimens that wealthier countries do.\nAs in other, real epidemics, responding to the logistical supply issues was complicated by false or misleading news reports, by on-line trolls, and by some people who just seem to want to sow discord and chaos. Fears are inflamed and people or countries can be targeted for blame. As we’ve seen with HIV, Ebola, and everything else, driving people underground and forcing them to hide illness fuels epidemics and travel and trade bans can devastate economies. None of these prevent the spread of an epidemic spread by air–or waterborne—transmission.\nAs the CAPS virus spread in the simulation, supplies were stretched and distribution was disrupted. How can countries plan for continued services and businesses for production? How can they maintain supply chains if there are trade or travel bans?\nHow can you assure equitable distribution of critical supplies? In this scenario, one country where the antiviral “Extranavir” was produced, planned on holding onto it, rather than exporting the drug.\nAs the virus spreads, economies become greatly weakened. Discussion turned to how to prevent collapse of governments, famine, and terrorism. Could the World Bank’s Contingency Emergency Response Components be used to allow existing loans to LMIC to be shifted to use for this public health emergency? Would the private sector help with financing? Can we mobilize and come together in such a global crisis? How—and who—will provide humanitarian aid?\nAs cases and deaths exploded exponentially, there was understandably more public panic, fueled by dis- and misinformation and conspiracy theories. Just as is occurring in the DRC now with Ebola, health care workers were being attacked and were unable to respond and try to contain the infections. How can this be countered?\nSuggested responses included disseminating reliable information aggressively, through both social media and companies educating their employees. Use “trusted sources,” like respected community leaders and religious groups, to help spread accurate information. Focus on risk communication , providing information quickly, accurately, and without fueling panic.\nRecommendations from the group were:\n1. Global business should recognize the economic burden of pandemics and really fight for stronger preparedness.\n2. How can corporate capabilities be used during a large-scale pandemic?\n3. The World Health Organization should work with industry and national governments to enhance internationally held stockpiles of MCMs (medical countermeasures) and personal protective equipment that could be equitably distributed.\n4. Countries and global transportation companies should work together to maintain travel and trade during a severe pandemic. (Previously, quarantines have been important for controlling epidemics; this was not presented here, likely unrealistic from the scale of the pandemic).\n5. Government should provide more resources and support for the development of surge manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\n6. We need to increase and reassess pandemic financial support.\n7. Governments and companies should increase coordination now to prepare to combat mis- and disinformation during a pandemic.\nWhat countries are the most prepared? This is what the Global Health Security Index suggests.\nJohns Hopkins Center for Health Security My personal assessment after watching this exercise was mixed. On the plus side, I was extremely impressed with the competence and thoughtful comments of many of the group’s members.\nBut my overall take was pessimism and foreboding, as we are woefully unprepared.\nDr. Eric Toner, senior scholar with the Center for Health Security and a Senior Scientist in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, cheered me a tad by noting that significant progress has been made since the last of these exercises. For example, he explained that there is now (since 2005) International Health Policy regulations that require countries to report incidents of international concern. Our ability to detect and develop countermeasures has improved significantly, and we now have BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) (not that I haven’t had misgivings about some of their projects, such as an anthrax vaccine ) and a National Stockpile, which was of use during the 2009 influenza pandemic.\nI have been particularly concerned about:\n— our reliance on other countries (like China) to provide the active ingredient for essential medicines.\n—the “distributive justice” issue. Recently, Indonesia did not want to share flu samples because they felt that they would not benefit from related discoveries, and that only wealthy countries would. Dr. Toner says this has been improved by the PIP (Pandemic influenza preparedness) framework.\nThere is similar unhappiness now over how some Ebola samples have been handled, fueling mistrust.\n—the rise in nationalism and protectionism in various countries does not bode well. The best response to a pandemic requires global cooperation and a certain altruism, to do what is best for the global community. That is essential for readiness.\nPerhaps the most reassuring observation from Dr. Toner was, “We’re trying to aim at making things better than they would be...I don’t think ‘prepared’ is a place…I think we can only be better prepared.”\nAs Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote,\nThe world is a beautiful place to be born into... but then right in the middle of it comes the smiling mortician.\nLawrence Ferlinghetti, in A Coney Island of the Mind, 1955 How much time do we have?", "external_links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/risks/index.html", "https://cdc.gov/healthcommunication/risks/index.html", "https://www.twitter.com/Iplaywithgerms", "https://twitter.com/Iplaywithgerms", "http://centerforhealthsecurity.org/", "http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201", "https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1185177627117666309.html", "http://centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/", "http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/", "http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org", "http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/molecules-to-medicine/anthrax-vaccine-to-the-victor-the-spoils/", "http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/", "https://www.threadreaderapp.com/thread/1185177627117666309.html", "http://www.blogs.scientificamerican.com/molecules-to-medicine/anthrax-vaccine-to-the-victor-the-spoils/", "http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/molecules-to-medicine/anthrax-vaccine-to-the-victor-the-spoils"], "published": "2019-12-12T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-12T20:28:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS pages of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP's Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the World Health Organization's latest news for more information and health advice.

Author: LaDyrian Cole Published: 7:31 PM CST December 5, 2019 Updated: 7:34 PM CST December 5, 2019\nTYLER, Texas — 'Tis the season of illness. As the holidays approach, people across East Texas are going to see the doctor for a variety of sicknesses.\n\"What we're seeing most of right now, over the last few weeks, Influenza B and RSV,” said Dr. Monique Mills with UT Health East Texas.\nShe says last year, the East Texas area mostly saw a different strain of the flu. However, as in winters before, Dr. Mills says the flu and Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) continue to be the two most common viruses impacting the area.\nRELATED: Doctors warn people not to kiss babies due to RSV on the rise\n\"Influenza can make people feel really bad for five to ten days in a row with coughing, fever, aches and pains. Sometimes, nausea and vomiting,\" Dr. Mills explained. \"Symptoms are similar with RSV, but typically RSV only causes truly significant respiratory symptoms with children who are a year old or younger, who are having their very first episode of RSV infection.”\nRELATED: Answering your FAQs on flu season\nWith flu numbers ticking upwards, Dr. Mills recommends that anyone six months and older get a flu shot.\n“Since we’ve had such an early and robust start to the flu season, what may happen is this serotype may peak and then slow down, and then, we may have another serotype that comes in and peaks again in January or February,” Dr. Mills said.\nRELATED: Flu Myths and Misconceptions Debunked\nExperts say flu, cold and other viruses spike during the winter time because the cold is better for their survival.\n\"There’s always about a half a dozen or so viruses that cause respiratory illness, and that includes rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus,” said Dr. Mills. “Those are all viruses that are always floating around in the community. Rhinovirus and adenovirus are your culprits year round for colds and flu-like symptoms.”\nShe says though these viruses are being spread in local communities, there are ways to potentially prevent getting sick.\n\"The single most effective way to reduce the spread of disease is with hand washing. Use hand sanitizer as often as you can, limit your exposure to sick family members,\" Dr. Mills explained. \"If you're sick, don't go to work. If your kids are sick, keep them at home.\"\nAlso, a reminder to parents to teach their kids to sneeze and cough in the crook of their arm instead of their hands. Mills says if you have holiday travel plans, it is smart to be familiar with what viruses are being spread in that area.\n\"It happens every year. They share their germs. You travel to a different state or to a different town on the other side of Texas and share their germs,\" Dr. Mills said. \"Everybody's fine until two to three days after they get back, and then, here come the new illnesses or the new strains of the illness that we haven't seen in this community.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2019-12-06T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-06T11:12:45.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A combination of as yet poorly understood host and viral factors combine to cause a minority of FCoV-infected cats to develop FIP. Clinicopathological features include fever, vasculitis, and serositis, with or without effusions; all of which indicate a pro-inflammatory state with cytokine release. As a result, primary immune organs, as well as circulating leukocytes, have thus far been of most interest in previous studies to determine the likely sources of these cytokines. Results have suggested that these tissues alone may not be sufficient to induce the observed inflammation. The current study therefore focussed on the liver and heart, organs with a demonstrated ability to produce cytokines and therefore with huge potential to exacerbate inflammatory processes. The IL-12:IL-10 ratio, a marker of the immune system’s inflammatory balance, was skewed towards the pro-inflammatory IL-12 in the liver of cats with FIP. Both organs were found to upregulate mRNA expression of the inflammatory triad of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in FIP. This amplifying step may be one of the missing links in the pathogenesis of this enigmatic disease.

We strongly advise travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to abstain from arranging camel rides and activities involving direct contact with camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV),\" a spokesman for the CHP said. Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene.

They welcomed visual artists Christine Davis and Scott Lyall to the Centre for Integrative Bio-Engineering Research ( Ciber lab s) for a collaboration that blended nanotechnology, art and communication.\nThe field of nanotechnology explores structures at the nanometre level—there are one million nanometres in one millimetre—and allows customizations at such a small scale that the resulting new materials can revolutionize technologies for a variety of applications including data transmission and storage, security and visual media. However, the development of new nano-materials is a challenging process.\n“We started from a problem that exists when working with nanostructured materials,” says Jiang, who helped to develop the processes that were fundamental to Nano-Verses .\n“Before this, if we wanted to make an image that was one centimetre by one centimetre in size using nano-optical image-making, it would take an entire week in the laboratory and thousands of dollars for each unique image,” he says.\nThese images, known as nano-optical variable devices, are the foundation for the shimmering anti-counterfeit images used in banknotes and concert tickets.\n“We created a whole new production process where it costs just as much to make one image as it does to make one thousand,” says Jiang. “That was an important development in terms of cost and scalability for this kind of technology and material.”\nInterested in exploring the new-found potential of their technology, Aleksandra introduced the Ciber team to Davis and Lyall with the intent of developing unique artwork that explores issues of scale, light and surface interactions.\nThey called the result NanoMedia.\nTo make NanoMedia, the Ciber researchers, led by Bozena and Jiang at SFU’s 4D LABS , applied light-sensitive chemicals onto a surface (substrate) that contains one billion nanostructures per square centimetre. These nanostructures can reflect any colour of light and be tuned to display pixels of specific colours.\nThen, in a process similar to developing film photographs, the chemicals/substrate are exposed to UV light or a UV laser writer and the pixels, now reflecting select colours in a predetermined arrangement, reveal the artist’s intended image or colour motif.\n“The whole process was very hands-on with the artists,” says Bozena. “We had to learn from each other to make the technology correspond to what they had in mind, and vice versa. We also had to learn to think about our technology differently, with different objectives and criteria.”\nAnd because the production process was so new to both the artists and the researchers, the team was challenged to experiment with many different combinations of substrates, chemicals, and finishing materials such as polymers, textiles and metals to best produce each of the artist’s visions.\nThe finished images can have high resolution—up to 12,700 pixels per inch—and appear iridescent as light reflects off each of the billions of tiny nanostructures in the finished medium . They can also tune the structures to reflect information in infrared light, the same as how a QR- or bar code functions.\nThe team’s first work resulted in 1,000 copies of a front-page insert for the 50th-anniversary edition of the Canadian interdisciplinary journal, PUBLIC . The image, designed with Davis, depicted iridescent nano-optical stars shimmering on a transparent material overlaid onto a photograph of a night-time forest . An example of the insert featured in Canadian interdisciplinary journal, PUBLIC.\nLater, with Lyall, they developed a series of framed art pieces on metal foils for an exhibition in New York City, U.S.A. Davis then used the foils to make luminescent objects, which she exhibited in Toronto, Canada. The artists have since produced additional shows of those pieces in Toronto and New York, as well as new artwork for shows in London, England and Paris, France, including at the prestigious Frieze art fairs .\nSince demonstrating the new production process for NanoMedia, the Ciber team is now commercializing it with industry partners. Because of NanoMedia’s complex fabrication process and unique structure, the resulting products are nearly impossible to counterfeit, making them ideal for the security printing industry for products such as banknotes and passports. Davis and Lyall, meanwhile, continue to work with the nano-optical material.\nThis month, Aleksandra (who is now a professor at the University of Montreal) launches a website that presents the multi-faceted nature of the project—“the many verses of NanoMedia.”\nThe website itself was built through experimentation with artists/web designers Frédérique Laliberté and Boris Dumesnil-Poulin. Together, they explored how to best present and communicate Nano-Verses from its inception, and how to communicate the way that a scientific idea was probed and studied by a variety of researchers and artists.\n“This was truly interdisciplinary,” says Bozena. “We took the highest fabrication techniques in nanotechnology and made an entirely new medium that is as intriguing for artists as it is useful for authentication and communication.”\nSays Jiang, “This project was a result of the efforts of our lab, the artists and our partners coming together to make something new. It was an amazing experience for everyone involved.”\nNano-Verses received funding from Canada Council for the Arts/GRAND NCE Media Artist and Scientist Collaboration grant and Mitacs’s Elevate postdoctoral fellowship program, in partnership with Nanotech Security Corp, IVW Covid, Raith America and PUBLIC. Professor Bozena Kaminska is also a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Wireless Sensor Networks.

Dublin.\nIn 1966, the Charolais heifers and bulls from France were quarantined on Spike Island in Cork Harbour, before arriving at their new home.\nHe continued to build up the herd here in Ireland, with famous sires such as: Shamrock Ambassador; Uranus; Emperor; Commander; and Flambeau. Other bulls such as Skidoo Champion and Skidoo Pacha are still popular among farmers today.\nIn 1995, Van Landeghem passed away and the farm and the herd were sold to local farmer and business professional, Pat McDonagh.\nHowever, the Charolais breed and history was maintained on the farm, and in 2010, the reins of the farm were taken by Cavan man, Donal Callery. Donal Callery with some of the Charolais cows prior to the sale\nToday, both the 100-cow Charolais pedigree herd – and the 160-cow commercial herd – are managed by Donal and his three-man team: assistant manager, Gerard Friel; stockman, Stephen Patton; and maintenance man, Anthony McDonagh. A tillage enterprise is also present on the farm.\n“The main focus and the main traits that Skidoo chased and always had was number one – easy calving, and number two – milky cows,” Donal explained, when describing the backbone of the herd.\n“I’m here 10 years and what we focused on was cow functionality – a cow that could rear a calf herself. She has to have milk; she has to be fertile; and she has to have a calf every 365 days, along with sound feet and legs.”\nThe pedigree herd is split calving – 50% spring and 50% autumn, while 60% of the commercial herd calves in the springtime, with the remaining 40% calving in the autumn.\nUp until this year, approximately 45 pedigree bulls were sold each year for breeding – direct off-farm – along with breeding heifers after replacements had been chosen – keeping to the tune of a closed herd with optimum herd health status.\n“Herd health is paramount in relation to bio-security, and we have a strict vaccination programme in place. Also, the farm is surrounded by tillage fields and a closed herd has been maintained for many years,” Donal added. The vaccination programme protects against: leptospirosis; bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD); infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR); blackleg; rotavirus; and coronavirus.\nHeifers from the commercial herd are finished on the farm aged 24 months, while bulls are sold at 12 months-of-age – weighing 500kg – for the under-16 month bull finishing market. The breeds used in the commercial herd include: Simmental; Limousin; and Charolais.\nHowever, the decision, a move which Donal admits wasn’t an easy one, was made last year – a switch from beef to dairy production. Image source: Tricia Kennedy\nFor the time being, the commercial herd (60% AI and 40% stock bulls) will be kept on the farm.\nWhen it comes to selecting bulls and sires, criteria was very much based around maternal traits, with the aim of building an elite-cow herd.\n“We wanted bulls that would be easy calving, high in fertility, and that were going to retain milk in the females,” Donal explained.\n“We were breeding an animal that was early maturing – that’s what the market requires; those big carcasses are finished. All our cows are medium sized, with high traits for milk, fertility, carcass and conformation.”\nThe herd is involved in the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) and Donal is a fan of the programme.\n“All the females here are genomically tested and that’s fantastic,” he added.\nIn 2018, 300 cows were calved down, so having an easy-calving system was paramount to the system.\nPedigree heifers calve aged two and a half, while 50% of the commercial heifers (spring calvers) are calved at 24 months and the remaining 50% are calved at 30 months (autumn calvers). Advertisement Image source: Tricia Kennedy\nThe breeding season for the autumn-calving cows starts on December 1, and finishes on February 1 – a strict eight-week breeding period.\nThe breeding period for the spring-calving herd commences on May 1 and continues until July 12. Additionally, all going to plan, weanlings are turned out to grass in early February.\nThe farm is described as extremely dry and Donal outlined that – in a normal year – cattle could be out grazing for 10 months of the year.\nTherefore, grass is the main constituent in the diet, with calves only receiving meal six weeks pre-weaning and during the indoor period (2kg/head/day).\n“We’re not selling any bulls at the moment because of the size of the sale, so we intend to have another sale for male animals in February next year,” Donal said. Image source: Tricia Kennedy\nThe pedigree herd uses 100% AI.\n“Our foundation cows are cows that are going back to the likes of: Bowerhouses Topper; Oldstone Egbert; Jupiter; Domino; Major – all the top female bloodlines; we have them.\n“The sires that are working very well at the moment are: Tombapic; Jumper, Nelson; Pirate; Doonally New – CF52 (terminal traits); Bivouac; and Bourgogne – there’s a whole array of them that we used,” the Cavan man explained. So, what’s next for Skidoo?\nWheels are already in motion for the next chapter on the Skidoo farm. In spring 2021, approximately 300 ‘black and white’ cows will enter into a new rotary parlour.\nThe overall target for the new dairy farm is 400 cows. While Donal is looking forward to this endeavor, he has not taken the decision lightly.\n“For this farm, beef farming at this stage is not justifiable as we pay staff because it’s 100% hired labour.\n“I’m from a dairy farming background; we have a dairy farm at home and I managed a dairy farm when I qualified as a farm manager.\n“Saying that, I went into beef, and enjoyed beef; beef farming has been very good to me. I really enjoyed it but I always had the liking for dairy.\n“To be honest, to disperse the pedigree Charolais herd here, you’re talking about genetics going back to 1966 – the first Charolais genetics that was introduced to Ireland; there was a lot of work put into breeding.\n“We have built up a herd that’s not alone known nationally, but internationally as well. It was a big decision that the pedigree Charolais herd has to go.\n“It was a thing that was not taken lightly, and it was a big decision to go away from beef farming; but for the moment, we are still retaining the commercial herd to see how things pan out,” Donal explained.\nInfrastructure on the farm is excellent and only minor adjustments have to be made to facilitate the new breed of cows, with the exception of the rotary parlour.\nWinter accommodation is adequate, and cubicles will be installed in the near future.\nSince taking over the managerial reins in 2010, Donal and his team have implemented a paddock and water system, and installed a road network throughout the holding.\nGrass management, grass measuring and AI are all familiar practices on the farm, so there will be nothing new for the team to grasp on that front.\n“We were already doing a lot of things that the dairy man does with the beef herd – grass measuring, heat detection and AI; Stephen and Gerard look after the AI department, so we’re up to speed there.\n“In relation to grassland management, we know how to utilise grass and we know how to breed good cows,” Donal added. Image source: Tricia Kennedy\nConcluding, Donal said: “I’m very keen on the dairying. Once we made up our minds, we were very happy to go down that road.\n“It will be a sad, sad day to see the herd dispersed, but I have no doubt that the Skidoo name will live on because people will buy the genetics here and will have them for years to come.” CLASSIFIED ADVERTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2019-12-30T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-30T16:14:44.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It's thought to have originated in Britain.\nThe idea is that the first words a person says on the first day of the month – even before greeting their rabbits, dogs or cats – are \"rabbit,\" \"rabbits\" or \"white rabbits.\" Some people say it twice, others three times. The person who does this will have good luck for the rest of the month, according to the superstition.\nAnother belief is that saying it will ensure that a present is delivered by the end of the month, or that a wish will come true.\nThe tradition of saying \"rabbit, rabbit\" occurs in the United States as well. It's sometimes associated with New England, but in an informal and completely unscientific poll, plenty of people from New England said they had never heard of the practice.\nStoryteller Sue-Ellen Stillwell-Jones, from the Midwest, first heard it when she was in her 20s, from other storytellers. Sally Bahner of Connecticut was familiar with it, and Megan Bellue learned it from a friend from Iowa. A colleague from Ireland told Lynn Miller to say \"white rabbit\" three times at midnight.\nFolklorists have gathered many examples over the years, including from people in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and New Mexico. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, from New York, said \"rabbits\" on the first of every month, according to one newspaper article. Author Simon Winchester claims to have gone 696 months – or 58 years – before forgetting to say it one month.\nIf you forget, wait until the end of the day, and say \"Tibbar, tibbar\" – rabbit backward, in other words.\nTHE BUZZ\n• Morris Animal Foundation is awarding more than $1 million in grants for 16 canine and feline research projects. Among the studies being funded are one to evaluate the potential of treating aggressive cancers with a new drug derived from a medicinal plant called feverfew; development of an oral vaccine for use in shelters and other multicat environments against feline enteric coronavirus, which can mutate to the deadly disease feline infectious peritonitis; and an inexpensive prognostic test to enable more rapid and appropriate treatment for canine neural injuries, such as strokes and acute spinal cord injuries.\n• Many pets and people were separated during Northern California's Kincade Fire, and rescuers are turning to social media to help reunite four-legged and two-legged family members. The Kincade Fire Pet Rescue and Reunification page on Facebook posts photos and descriptions of lost and found pets. In Southern California, volunteers from the equestrian community often pitch in to help rescue horses through a Facebook group called Southern California Equine Emergency Evacuation. Cowboy 911, also on Facebook, has listings to help connect rescuers, shelters, owners and animals, including dogs, birds, horses, pigs and even wildlife. Reunification can take months as people seek new housing or more animals are found, so it's important to continue checking or to renew a lost or found pet's listing.\n• Often, dog breeds come in different coat varieties. There's the familiar rough collie – think Lassie – as well as a smooth, or shorthaired, collie. Fox terriers have smooth or wire coats; Chihuahuas have short or long coats; dachshunds come in smooth, long or wirehaired coats; Jack Russell terriers have smooth, broken or rough coats; Brussels griffons have rough and smooth coats; Portuguese podengos have smooth and wire coats; and Pyrenean shepherds have smooth- and rough-faced varieties.\nPet Connection is produced by a team of pet-care experts headed by veterinarian Marty Becker and journalist Kim Campbell Thornton of Vetstreet.com.

It is not considered easily spread between humans, and is often transmitted to people via contact with rodents. The disease is mostly seen in western and central African countries. Sep 26, 2018, CIDRAP News story \" UK confirms monkeypox in healthcare worker \"\nEbola response still impeded in wake of violent attacks\nThe World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard shows no new cases today, a sign the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is still hindered after violent attacks in Biakato Mines and Mangina last week that caused workers to retreat from the outbreak's hot spots.\nIn the latest situation report on the outbreak, the WHO's African regional office said the targeted attacks have severely restricted access to affected communities in multiple locations.\n\"As seen previously during this outbreak, such disruptions limit contact tracing, surveillance, and vaccination efforts, and they may result in increased transmission,\" the WHO said. \"Following insecurity, the volume of reported daily alerts from healthcare facilities and the community dropped in Beni in the six-day period from 23 to 28 November 2019 from approximately 400 per day to approximately 170.\"\nFrom Nov 25 to Dec 1, the WHO tracked 10 new cases of the deadly virus, half from Mabalako and half from Mandima.\nIn a promising development, the WHO's regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, MD, announced on Twitter today that Butembo, a former hot spot, has gone 42 days without a new Ebola case. Dec 3 WHO situation report Dec 4 Matshidiso Moeti tweet\nSaudi Arabia tracks first MERS case of December\nToday Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported one more MERS-CoV case, in a 65-year-old man from Hafar Al Batin, a town in the northern part of the country.\nThe MOH said the man had contact with camels, and his MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) exposure is classified as primary, meaning he probably wasn't exposed to another MERS patient. He is not a healthcare worker.\nThis is the first MERS case reported in December. Eleven cases were recorded in November, compared with 14 in October and 4 in September.\nAs of the end of October, the WHO has received reports of 2,482 cases, at least 854 of them fatal, since the disease was first identified in 2012. Saudi Arabia has been by far the hardest-hit country. Dec 4 MOH report\nSurvey finds 44% of adults have been vaccinated against flu\nAccording to a new survey, as of early November, 44% of adults said they had been vaccinated against flu, and 18% said haven't been immunized but intend to do so. Results from a poll from the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago also revealed that 37% of adults don't plan on getting the flu vaccine.\nThe findings are similar to the group's survey from last year; 2018 vaccine uptake was 43%, and the percentage who said they wouldn't get a flu shot was 41%—both within the poll's margin of error.\nPeople older than 60 had the highest uptake, at 65%, but one in five of that age-group still don't plan on being vaccinated, though they are at higher risk of flu complications. Vaccination rates are typically lowest in adults ages 45 to 59, and the survey found that only 34% have been vaccinated already.\nWhen asked why they didn't plan on being vaccinated, adults were most likely to voice concerns about side effects (37%) or that the vaccine doesn't work very well (36%).\nResearchers conducted the poll between Nov 7 and Nov 11, and it includes 1,020 interviews with a nationally representative sample. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.06%.\nCaroline Pearson, NORC's senior vice president, said in a NORC press release that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that this year's flu season is off to an early start in most states and has already been linked to deaths. \"This year's vaccine appears well matched against the current strains, and widespread vaccination remains our best defense against this sometimes deadly virus.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330032/SITREP_EVD_DRC_20191203-eng.pdf", "https://moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/events/national/Documents/Epiwk49-19.pdf", "http://www.rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "https://www.twitter.com/MoetiTshidi/status/1202169092096086016", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://www.printfriendly.com", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content", "https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330032/SITREP_EVD_DRC_20191203-eng.pdf", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1", "http://printfriendly.com", "http://www.xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "https://twitter.com/MoetiTshidi/status/1202169092096086016", "http://www.purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms", "https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/events/national/Documents/Epiwk49-19.pdf", "http://www.purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://www.rdfs.org/sioc/types#"], "published": "2019-12-04T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-05T03:48:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A combination of as yet poorly understood host and viral factors combine to cause a minority of FCoV-infected cats to develop FIP. Clinicopathological features include fever, vasculitis, and serositis, with or without effusions; all of which indicate a pro-inflammatory state with cytokine release. As a result, primary immune organs, as well as circulating leukocytes, have thus far been of most interest in previous studies to determine the likely sources of these cytokines. Results have suggested that these tissues alone may not be sufficient to induce the observed inflammation. The current study therefore focussed on the liver and heart, organs with a demonstrated ability to produce cytokines and therefore with huge potential to exacerbate inflammatory processes. The IL-12:IL-10 ratio, a marker of the immune system’s inflammatory balance, was skewed towards the pro-inflammatory IL-12 in the liver of cats with FIP. Both organs were found to upregulate mRNA expression of the inflammatory triad of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in FIP. This amplifying step may be one of the missing links in the pathogenesis of this enigmatic disease. 2 views Category: Epidemiology , Virology", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/share", "http://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2019-12-10T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-11T00:08:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The CHP again urged the public to pay special attention to safety during travel, taking due consideration of the health risks in the places they visit. According to the WHO, this was a cluster affecting three persons aged 32 to 67. The index case is a 67-year-old woman with underlying illnesses who had passed away. The other two cases were identified through contact tracing and both are in a stable condition. Investigations are ongoing. According to the latest information, 2 497 cases have been reported to the WHO (with 859 deaths), including 2 278 in 10 Middle East countries comprising 2 102 in Saudi Arabia, 88 in the United Arab Emirates, 28 in Jordan, 24 in Oman, 22 in Qatar, six in Iran, four in Kuwait, two in Lebanon, and one each in Yemen and Bahrain. \"We will maintain close communication with the WHO and relevant health authorities,\" a spokesman for the CHP said. \"As countries in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, continue to report MERS cases from time to time, travellers should refrain from going to farms, barns or markets with camels and avoid contact with sick persons and animals, especially camels, birds or poultry. Most of the cases reported in the Middle East had a history of exposure to camels, consumption of camel milk or contact with other MERS patients,\" the spokesman said. \"Scientific evidence has shown that camels are reservoirs for MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Camels infected with MERS-CoV may not show any signs of infection. Infected animals may shed MERS-CoV through nasal and eye discharge and faeces, and potentially in their milk and urine. The virus may also be found in the raw organs and meat of infected animals. Therefore, the best protection is to practise good hygiene and avoid direct contact with all of these,\" the spokesman added. From time to time, suspected MERS cases reported to the CHP for investigation involve patients with a history of contact with camels in the Middle East. The CHP strongly advises travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to abstain from arranging camel rides and activities involving direct contact with camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS page of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP's Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the WHO's latest news for more information and health advice.

The virus was ultimately named Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and has been endemic in Saudi Arabia since 2012. As of September 2019, 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases with 851 associated deaths have occurred with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, according to the World Health Organization. An imported case of MERS occurred in South Korea in 2015, stimulating a multi-month outbreak. Several distinguishing factors emerge upon epidemiological and sociological analysis of the two outbreaks including public awareness of the MERS outbreak, and transmission and synchronization of governing healthcare bodies. South Korea implemented a stringent healthcare model that protected patients and healthcare workers alike through prevention and high levels of public information. In addition, many details about MERS-CoV virology, transmission, pathological progression, and even the reservoir, remain unknown. This paper aims to delineate the key differences between the two regional outbreaks from both a healthcare and personal perspective including differing hospital practices, information and public knowledge, cultural practices, and reservoirs, among others. Further details about differing emergency outbreak responses, public information, and guidelines put in place to protect hospitals and citizens could improve the outcome of future MERS outbreaks.

Employing nine full-time staff in Kyabram, and currently sourcing more camels to add to their 300 strong herd in order to meet demand, the Camel Milk Company has been a success story for owners Megan (pictured) and Chris Williams. Insight & People , Livestock , North East & Goulburn-Murray Farmer , camel , Camel Milk Company Australia , Chris Williams , Megan Williams\nThe Camel Milk Company Australia is busy.\nOn a single day in early November, Channel Nine was there conducting an interview as news had just broken that camel milk was now recognised under the Dairy Act of Victoria, allowing the product to fall under dairy food safe legislation and as a result make licensing and export easier.\nAn older farming couple had pulled into the car park enticed by the paddock after paddock of browsing camels, and were inquisitive to know more.\nAnd unanticipated, a busload of 24 on a Probus excursion had suddenly arrived keen to participate in a tour of the farm.\nMegan Williams, co-owner of the Camel Milk Company, had sprung into action and within minutes chairs had been set-up and displays positioned and the tour had begun.\nThis would be her first group for the week, but the following two days had three tours already booked in, and this was all on top of running a working farm and negotiating a family of three young boys, one at home, one at kinder and one at school.\nMegan and her husband, Chris, live on-farm on 480 acres just outside of Kyabram, and run between 300 and 400 camels at any one time.\nThe camels predominantly come from the outback, wild camels that roam the vast open space descended from the original camels brought over by cameleers from Afghanistan in the 1860s.\nFundamental to the colonisation of the Australian interior, the cameleers and their camels worked in nearly all areas of transportation from exploration, to mining and the supply of provisions to homesteads.\nThe introduction of cars and trucks into Australia in the 1920s, saw the camels and their handlers become redundant, and though some cameleers remained and became small property owners the majority returned home.\nTaking the camels home wasn’t really an option, and the cameleers were instructed to shoot their camels.\n“These people had the strongest bonds with their beasts and been made to sleep with their camels as they weren’t allowed into mainstream community,” Megan said.\n“They had a rough time, and with their camels had played an incredible role in building and pioneering outback Australia, so when they were told to shoot the camels many set them free.”\nWith no natural predators, apart from humans and a climate to which they are particularly suited, the camels have thrived and as such are considered a pest, ringbarking trees, wrecking water bores and troughs, and destroying pastoralists’ fencing.\nAerial culls have more than halved the estimated number of wild camels in Australia, with the total reduced from 750,000 to 300,000 in the last decade.\nHowever, with an animal that is fairly easy to domesticate, wholesale culling may not be the best use of this resource.\nWhen the original Afghani camels were brought over only the biggest and strongest were chosen for the task, and the core genetics of the Australian camels are now superior to their Middle Eastern ancestors.\nAustralia also has the only disease free status in the world for camel-spread Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and as such the camels themselves are sought after as an export item, and Australian produced camel milk does not require boiling first before consumption.\nWith shortages in camel products and camel milk due to the virus which is transferable between camels and people and specifically through camel products, there is a huge overseas and burgeoning local market for Australian camel milk.\nIt was this perceived demand for camel milk that inspired Megan and Chris Williams to take the leap of faith in 2014 and turn their interest in camels into a business. THE WHOLE CAMEL: Tee Rowe has been with the Camel Milk Company since 2016, and as a qualified vet nurse her assistance has been invaluable with the camels, with prevention rather than cure the company’s motto. Not only does the company produce camel milk and camel milk powder, it has a whole skin care range, and as the company prefers to treat its animals holistically with apple cider vinegar and garlic, all products are free of nasties.\n“Chris and I met in 2008 in Alice Springs,” Megan said.\n“Chris was from Wales and was on a working visa, and I was a tour guide out at Uluru, and learning heaps, among other things, about early explorers and camels.\n“I was just really intrigued with them.\n“Now I’m a born and bred Kyabram girl.\n“I went to school here and learned my trade here.\n“The community is amazing and incredibly supportive, and I always perceived myself returning.\n“I never really enjoyed school, preferring working on my parents’ property, and wanted to follow my father into dairy.\n“So when Chris and I decided to leave the Northern Territory, we moved to the original family farm, and share farmed with my mum and dad.\n“But obviously there was something about camels that had caught my attention, and after watching this fascinating documentary on camel milk and its health benefits, I said to Chris ‘We’re going to milk camels’.\n“I don’t know how serious he thought I was at the time, but I kept sending him all these links about camel milk, about what camels eat, about how we could house them, and in 2014 the first three camels arrived on our, then, 107 acre property.\n“The original three came from Bordertown in South Australia, and the lady who had them had got them wild and tamed them down.\n“This was lovely for us – newbies to working up close and personal with camels – and we also did a camel handler course with a gentleman called Peter Hodge, who is amazing with camels and conducts camel rides all over Australia.\n“Peter explained what he did with the camels but always emphasised that we needed to do what worked for us.\n“So he taught us about camels, and we taught ourselves about milking them.”\nMilking a camel is a slow process.\nThere is the transition from the dry paddock to the maternity paddock with halter and lead feeding to ready them for being handled twice daily when milking.\nCamels have their first calf when they’re between four and five years old, and are pregnant for between 12 and 14 months, naturally weaning the calf off at about the 18 month mark.\nThe Camel Milk Company will not join camels when they’re milking, and as a result the camels only calve every three to three and a half years.\nThe calves are born without a hump (which is effectively a fat deposit that develops over time) and are kept with the mothers exclusively for up to a week to ensure they get the essential colostrum for their gut and overall health.\nThe mother camel and her calf are then walked through the purpose built dairy to acclimatise them both to the space.\nAs the calf’s suckling is needed to stimulate milk production and let down in the mother, the camels are always stopped in the milking position with their babies beside them.\nThe milking machinery is then turned on so that they get used to the noise and only when both the mother and calf are comfortable with the entire process, does the Camel Milk Company even attempt to milk.\n“You can’t just take milk from a camel,” Megan said.\n“They have to give it to you.\n“It has to be relaxed enough to milk, in a safe and gentle environment.\n“Otherwise it won’t give you milk.\n“A tell-tale sign with an unhappy camel is its poo.\n“Normally round and firm, as soon as it becomes runny, we know they are upset and nervous and that’s when we stop and only ever progress when the camel is ready.”\nAlthough individual camels all respond a little differently, this set routine introducing the mothers to milking seems to work for the Camel Milk Company.\nOnce the routine is set, the baby camels are separated from the mothers for two hours before milking to develop an appetite.\nThe mothers are then led into the yards in the dairy, with a bar at either end of the camel to secure it in place.\nThe calf which has been tethered on one side of the dairy is then led over to the mother, the pairs identifiable by ear tags on the mother matching a velcro collar on the baby.\nLet off, the calf suckles and stimulates the letdown, and only then are the cups from the mini milkers put on the camel’s teats, milking from the side as opposed to from behind like with cows.\nThe camels are never over-milked to ensure there is enough milk left for the calves, and as a result each beast produces about five litres a day, with the Camel Milk Company currently milking 60 of their 300 plus camels.\nBatch pasteurised at a gentle 63 degrees, the milk is hot held for 30 minutes and then gradually cooled.\nIncredibly white and slightly salty to the taste, the milk is as natural as can be and is not homogenised.\nIt is touted for its benefits to skin and gut health, and is high in potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron and a source of vitamin C.\n“Low in fat and lactose, and not containing any whey proteins, it is perfect for those with intolerances and allergies,” Megan said.\n“And it’s considered a whole food, so if you were to survive on camel milk alone it would sustain you.”\nWith this in mind, and the knowledge of the invaluable work that camels did in colonising Australia, it is easy to see what initially intrigued Megan and Chris with these curious creatures.\nTheir commanding presence and guttural moaning, along with an over-riding inquisitiveness, makes them incredibly endearing and a more than exciting farming prospect.\nAnd though the Williams initially were met with good-natured chuckles when they began their camel dairy, they have become industry leaders, the biggest dairy of its kind in Australia and a source of Kyabram pride.

The market is estimated to grow with a CAGR of 6.7% from 2019-2027. Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05833629/?utm_source=PRN The key factors that are driving the growth of veterinary endoscopes market are increasing pet animal's population, growing training programs for endoscopic diagnosis and rising incidences of zoonotic diseases over the forecasted years. Also, the growth opportunities in the developing nations are likely to have a positive impact on the growth of the market in the coming years.Zoonotic diseases are an infectious disease which is transmitted to humans through vertebrate animals.The zoonotic diseases further three major types, such as endemic zoonoses, epidemic zoonoses, and emerging and re-emerging zoonoses.Among these types of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are emerging and showing increasing incidences in various geographic areas.For instance, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is stated that nearly 61% of the human pathogens are zoonotic.Diseases such as Rift Valley fever, SARS, pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, Yellow fever, Avian Influenza (H5N1), and (H7N9), West Nile virus are zoonotic.In addition, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was increased rapidly in recent years, was caused by a zoonotic pathogen.Moreover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is stated that approximately ten thousand Americans are estimated to get affected by zoonotic diseases.The major source for transmission of diseases is animals consumed, such as goat meat, beef, pork, chicken, and others.According to the CDC, it is stated that six out of ten infectious diseases in people are zoonotic diseases. Thus, owing to the rising incidences and risk of the zoonotic diseases are likely to drive the growth of veterinary endoscopes during the forecast period.The veterinary endoscopes market is segmented on the basis of product type, application, procedures and end user.The market based on product type segment is classified as capsule endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and rigid endoscopes.On the basis application the market is segmented as diagnostic and surgical.Based on the procedure the market is classified as bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, gastrointestinal, laparoscopy, otoscopy, and other procedure types.And on the basis of end user the market is divided into veterinary clinic, veterinary hospitals and other end users.About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

It has two serotypes (type I FCoV and type II FCoV). According to our previous study, type I FCoV infection is inhibited by compounds inducing intracellular cholesterol accumulation, whereas type II FCoV infection is not inhibited. Intracellular cholesterol accumulation was reported to disrupt late endosome function. Based on these findings, types I and II FCoV are considered to enter the cytosol through late and early endosomes, respectively. We investigated whether the antiviral activities of a late endosome trafficking inhibitor and cholesterol-accumulating agents are different between the FCoV serotypes. The late endosome trafficking inhibitor did not inhibit type II FCoV infection, but it inhibited type I FCoV infection. Type I FCoV infection was inhibited by cholesterol-accumulating triazoles, but not by non-cholesterol-accumulating triazoles. These phenomena were observed in both feline cell lines and feline primary macrophages. This study provides additional information on the differences in intracellular reproductive cycle between type I and type II FCoV. ► ▼ Show Figures\nGraphical abstract MDPI and ACS Style\nTakano, T.; Wakayama, Y.; Doki, T.

Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca 2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca 2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca 2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca 2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca 2+ , as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca 2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca 2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.

We strongly advise travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to abstain from arranging camel rides and activities involving direct contact with camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV),\" a spokesman for the CHP said. Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene.

The case is detailed below: Pending \"Travellers to the Middle East should avoid going to farms, barns or markets with camels; avoid contact with sick persons and animals, especially camels, birds or poultry; and avoid unnecessary visits to healthcare facilities. We strongly advise travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to abstain from arranging camel rides and activities involving direct contact with camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV),\" a spokesman for the CHP said. Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS pages of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP's Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the World Health Organization's latest news for more information and health advice.

The cases were reported from Riyadh (4), Madinah (2), Al-Qassim (1), Assir (1), Taif (1), and Makkah (1) regions.\nThe link below provides details of the 10 reported cases: xls, 121kb\nFrom 2012 through 30 November 2019, a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 858 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the International Health regulations (IHR 2005). The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states. WHO risk assessment\nInfection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.\nThe notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting or household contacts).\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO advice\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\nEarly identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\nMERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

The zoonotic diseases further three major types, such as endemic zoonoses, epidemic zoonoses, and emerging and re-emerging zoonoses. Among these types of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are emerging and showing increasing incidences in various geographic areas.\nFor instance, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is stated that nearly 61% of the human pathogens are zoonotic. Diseases such as Rift Valley fever, SARS, pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, Yellow fever, Avian Influenza (H5N1), and (H7N9), West Nile virus are zoonotic. In addition, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was increased rapidly in recent years, was caused by a zoonotic pathogen.\nMoreover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is stated that approximately ten thousand Americans are estimated to get affected by zoonotic diseases. The major source for transmission of diseases is animals consumed, such as goat meat, beef, pork, chicken, and others. According to the CDC, it is stated that six out of ten infectious diseases in people are zoonotic diseases. Thus, owing to the rising incidences and risk of the zoonotic diseases are likely to drive the growth of veterinary endoscopes during the forecast period.\nThe veterinary endoscopes market is segmented on the basis of product type, application, procedures and end user. The market based on product type segment is classified as capsule endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and rigid endoscopes. On the basis application the market is segmented as diagnostic and surgical.

This includes all use-by dates and brands of romaine lettuce from this region,\" the agency said. No common grower, supplier, distributor, or brand of romaine lettuce has been identified, it added.\nNo deaths have been recorded in this outbreak, but 58 people have been hospitalized, with 10 developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. Illness-onset dates range from Sep 24 through Nov 18.\nWisconsin has been hardest hit during this outbreak, with 31 cases. Ohio has reported 12, Pennsylvania has 8, and New Jersey has seen 7 illnesses. Dec 4 CDC update\nHealthcare-related infections among October Saudi MERS cases\nOf the 15 cases of MERS-CoV reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in October, 4 involved healthcare-related clusters, the agency said today in an update.\nRiyadh reported the most October MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infections, at 6, followed by Aseer (5), Al Qassim (3), and Taif (1).\nThe first cluster involved a 39-year-old male patient in Aseer province and a 26-year-old female healthcare worker (HCW). The other cluster involved a 32-year-old male patient and a 49-year-old female HCW in Riyadh.\nFive of the 15 patients, all with diabetes, died. Six other patients had diabetes, and, of the 11 diabetic patients, 8 had other underlying medical conditions, as well. One patient without diabetes—the 49-year-old female HCW—had high blood pressure. Only 3 patients had no preexisting condition.\nThree of the patients reported recent camel contact, which is a known MERS risk factor. All three drank camel milk. All 15 patients were adults who required hospitalization, and only 3 were women. Patient ages ranged from 26 to 94.\nThe WHO said that, since the disease was first reported in 2012, it has received reports of 2,484 lab-confirmed cases, including 857 deaths. Saudi Arabia has been by far the hardest-hit nation. Dec 5 WHO update\nGeorgia girl hospitalized with Eastern equine encephalitis\nAn 8-year-old girl from Savannah, Georgia, was hospitalized for 1 month after contracting Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) a rare mosquito-borne disease, according to a media report flagged on ProMED Mail, the online reporting system of the International Society for Infectious Diseases.\nThe girl—who suffered extensive brain damage—is still recovering from the illness, which took doctors several weeks to correctly diagnose. She was admitted to the hospital on Nov 4, and was not diagnosed with EEE until Dec 2. ProMEd cites a report from WTOC, a Savannah TV station.\nAs of Dec 3, the CDC said officials have confirmed 37 EEE case this year, including 15 deaths (40.5%), reported in nine states other than Georgia: Alabama (1), Connecticut (4), Indiana (1), Massachusetts (12), Michigan (10), North Carolina (1), New Jersey (4), Rhode Island (3), and Tennessee (1).\nThe CDC tracks an average of 7 EEE cases annually, with 30% resulting in death. Typically, cases come from the Gulf states. Many survivors suffer long-term neurologic problems. Dec 4 ProMed Mail post Dec 3 CDC EEE report\nFDA, NIH create app for novel drug use for difficult-to-treat infections\nToday the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the global launch of CURE ID, a web-based repository to allow HCWs to report their experiences treating difficult-to-treat infectious diseases with novel uses of existing FDA-approved drugs.\nThe app enables the crowdsourcing of medical data from HCWs to guide interventions and facilitate the development of new drugs for neglected diseases. It can be accessed via smart phone, tablet, or other mobile device, or via a website. CURE ID is a collaboration between the FDA and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, which is part of the National Institutes of Health.\nThe repository captures clinical outcomes when professionals prescribe drugs for new indications, in new populations, in new doses, or in new combinations. HCWs are allowed to prescribe a legally marketed human drug or device for an unapproved or uncleared use when they deem it appropriate for an individual patient.\n\"The CURE ID application focuses on drugs for infectious diseases lacking adequate treatments, including neglected tropical diseases, emerging infectious threats and infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant organisms,\" said Amy Abernethy, MD, PhD, an FDA principal deputy commissioner, in an FDA news release. \"When health care professionals directly input their clinical cases into the app, CURE ID allows these real-world experiences to be organized and analyzed much faster, making it easier to spot promising new uses for existing drugs.\" FDA CURE ID landing page\nOsivax and NIAID ink plan to test universal flu vaccine\nOsivax, a pharmaceutical firm based in Lyon, France, announced today that it has signed an agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to continue development of the company's universal flu vaccine candidate.\nThe vaccine, known as OVX836, targets nucleoprotein, a highly conserved antigen in influenza viruses. Osivax said in a press release that it is funding a phase 1 trial of the vaccine.\nAs part of the agreement, Osivax will use NIAID's preclinical services to do a more detailed immunologic assessment of OVX836, including its effect on cellular immune, CD4, CD8, and T-cell response. The company said the studies will enable it to get a deeper and more complete assessment of the vaccine's impact.

In this themed issue of the Journal of Innate Immunity , the innate immune system of the lung takes center stage in 4 review papers and 5 original research papers. These papers demonstrate our rapidly increasing insight into innate immunity in the lung, as well as the challenges ahead to better exploit this knowledge for new treatments of common and rare lung diseases. In her review, Kikkert [ 1 ] discusses the arms race between host innate immunity and evasion of this immunity by respiratory viruses. Infections with respiratory viruses such as influenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus are an important problem in the general population, as well as in subjects with chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas infection with corona viruses (CoVs) such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and bird flu-causing avian influenza have made the headlines in the media in recent years. Suppression of antiviral defenses is a strategy employed by most viruses, and insight into the mechanisms underlying this evasion is essential to better prevent and treat respiratory viral infections. With a focus on RNA viruses, she illustrates how viruses escape recognition by intracellular sensors, use enzymatic activity to suppress innate immunity, and how viruses manipulate the ubiquitin system. One of the mechanisms by which pathogens can be cleared is autophagy, and the role of autophagy in innate immunity is the topic of the review by Rao and Eissa [ 2 ]. This intracellular digestion system not only contributes to host defense against respiratory infection, but is also essential for maintaining cellular function by degrading macromolecules and dysfunctional organelles, and by generating nutrients in case of nutrient starvation. Dysfunction of autophagy leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in stressed cells, which may result in inflammation. This review serves both as an introduction to autophagy as an intracellular recycling system, as well as a detailed discussion of its relation to lung innate immunity including the way it controls unwanted activation of the inflammasome. The discussion on how some pathogens may evade clearance by autophagy stresses the role of autophagy in host defense against infection, and further broadens the scope of mechanisms discussed by Kikkert [ 1 ] that allow viruses to escape cellular defense systems. Metabolic reprogramming in innate immunity and how it contributes to a variety of lung diseases is the focus of the review by Michaeloudes et al. [ 3 ]. It builds on pioneering studies showing the role of cellular metabolism and its reprogramming in cancer and innate immunity. Metabolic changes are induced during activation of the innate immune system, but also employed by micro-organisms to escape defense. A shift to glycolysis at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation is especially characteristic of proinflammatory polarization of macrophages and dendritic cells. These changes allow for adaptation to their pro-inflammatory function, including mediator production and killing of pathogens. Importantly, the authors demonstrate how deregulation of metabolic reprogramming in asthma and COPD may contribute to dysregulated innate immunity. The therapeutic potential of this area of research is strengthened by the availability of drugs that target metabolic pathways and that are being evaluated in cancer trials, for example. Following their introduction as new kids on the block a decade ago, the role of the various subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in immunity and pathogenesis of lung diseases is now widely recognized and studied. van der Ploeg et al. [ 4 ] discuss the role of ILC2 in human lung diseases. They describe the development and tissue localization of ILC2, their regulation and plasticity, and neuronal and metabolic control of these cells. Next, insight is provided into their role in immunity and lung diseases such as asthma, COPD, lung fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis, based on lessons learned from animal models and human studies. In their outlook, they refer to promising results of studies targeting type 2 immunity driven by ILC2 in allergic airway diseases. Following this series of reviews covering various aspects of innate immunity of the lung, and elaborating on themes such as escape mechanisms allowing pathogens to evade innate immunity, the role of metabolic reprogramming, and therapeutic prospects of unravelling innate immunity, this issue of the Journal of Innate Immunity also includes 5 original research papers focused on epithelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Microbial recognition is central in innate immunity to respiratory infection, and Toll-like receptors (TLR) are an essential part of the pulmonary toolbox of innate immunity that enables it to sense pathogen presence. Grassin-Delyle et al. [ 5 ] studied expression and function of TLRs on human lung macrophages isolated from resected lung tissue. Expression of the diverse repertoire of TLRs and response to subtype-specific TLR agonists revealed a remarkably wide spectrum. Interestingly, little interpatient variation was observed in TLR expression levels, with the exception of TLR8. M1 polarization was not only observed in response to LPS, but also to a range of other TLR agonists. The use of primary human macrophages isolated from resected lung tissue is a particular strength of this study, revealing important differences with, for example, studies using lung macrophages derived from mice. In addition to macrophages and other lung cells, the airway epithelial cells that line the airway lumen also use a range of TLRs to monitor microbial presence at the epithelial surface, and this may lead to an enhanced production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that serve as effector molecules of innate immunity by killing micro-organisms, modulating immunity, and enhancing wound repair. Importantly, vitamin D is now also recognized as a regulator of production of selected AMPs such as the human cathelicidin LL-37. Schrumpf et al. [ 6 ] used differentiated cultures of airway epithelial cells to show that vitamin D increases the production of AMPs such as hCAP18/LL-37, but that this is reduced by TGF-β1. Expression of the multifunctional cytokine and growth factor TGF-β1 is increased in various lung diseases, including COPD. They went on to show that TGF-β1 modulates epithelial cell metabolism of vitamin D by increasing expression of the vitamin D-degrading enzyme CYP24A1, and also reduces the expression of a range of constitutively produced host defense molecules in part by skewing epithelial differentiation towards a reduction in secretory cells. One of the host defense molecules that was regulated by TGF-β1 in the study of Schrumpf et al. [ 6 ], the antimicrobial proteinase inhibitor secretory leucoprotease inhibitor (SLPI), is the central research topic of the study by McKiernan et al. [ 7 ]. SLPI, which also displays immunomodulatory effects, is not only produced by epithelial cells, but also by monocytes, amongst others. Sex-related differences in chronic inflammatory diseases and susceptibility to respiratory infections are the background of their study. They demonstrate that estrogen decreases the expression of SLPI by monocytes, and provide evidence that this is mediated by an increase in miR-19. Thereby, they delineate one of the mechanisms by which estrogen modulates the innate immune system. Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) is an adaptor protein that is a negative regulator of TLR and IL-1 receptor signaling. Dakhama et al. [ 8 ] studied the role of Tollip in rhinovirus infection in a type 2 cytokine environment to mimic conditions in allergic asthma, where rhinovirus contributes to exacerebations. Tollip was previously found to control activation of IRAK1, which acts downstream not only of TLRs and the IL-1 receptor, but also mediates signaling of the IL-33 receptor ST2. Using human primary epithelial cells and mouse models, they showed how Tollip restricts IL-8 production in response to rhinovirus infection in the presence of type 2 allergic inflammatory conditions, and demonstrated involvement of Tollip in the production of soluble ST2 that can restrict the activity of IL-33. Finally, the study by Yue et al. [ 9 ] also focused on a type 2 cytokine environment and epithelial cells. They studied the regulation of inflammatory cytokines and mucus production by nasal epithelial cells in allergic rhinitis. The type 2 cytokine IL-13 is a well-known inducer of mucin production in epithelial cells, and Yue et al. [ 9 ] demonstrated that the long noncoding RNA Linc00632 blocks IL-13 induced GM-CSF, eotaxin, and MUC5AC production by targeting miR-498. Importantly, they found that Linc00632 is decreased in nasal mucosal tissues from patients with allergic rhinitis and in IL-13-treated epithelial cells. The series of articles in this issue of the journal demonstrates the breath of research on innate immunity in the lung and its implications for understanding the development and progression of a range of lung diseases. It also highlights various aspects of innate immunity in the lung and how these can be influenced by and exert influence on other mechanisms including cellular metabolism. The clinical implications of this research include identification of targets for innovative treatment strategies to better prevent and treat the respiratory diseases that affect so many patients worldwide.

The market is estimated to grow with a CAGR of 6.7% from 2019-2027. Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05833629/?utm_source=PRN The key factors that are driving the growth of veterinary endoscopes market are increasing pet animal's population, growing training programs for endoscopic diagnosis and rising incidences of zoonotic diseases over the forecasted years. Also, the growth opportunities in the developing nations are likely to have a positive impact on the growth of the market in the coming years.Zoonotic diseases are an infectious disease which is transmitted to humans through vertebrate animals.The zoonotic diseases further three major types, such as endemic zoonoses, epidemic zoonoses, and emerging and re-emerging zoonoses.Among these types of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are emerging and showing increasing incidences in various geographic areas.For instance, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is stated that nearly 61% of the human pathogens are zoonotic.Diseases such as Rift Valley fever, SARS, pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, Yellow fever, Avian Influenza (H5N1), and (H7N9), West Nile virus are zoonotic.In addition, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was increased rapidly in recent years, was caused by a zoonotic pathogen.Moreover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is stated that approximately ten thousand Americans are estimated to get affected by zoonotic diseases.The major source for transmission of diseases is animals consumed, such as goat meat, beef, pork, chicken, and others.According to the CDC, it is stated that six out of ten infectious diseases in people are zoonotic diseases. Thus, owing to the rising incidences and risk of the zoonotic diseases are likely to drive the growth of veterinary endoscopes during the forecast period.The veterinary endoscopes market is segmented on the basis of product type, application, procedures and end user.The market based on product type segment is classified as capsule endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and rigid endoscopes.On the basis application the market is segmented as diagnostic and surgical.Based on the procedure the market is classified as bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, gastrointestinal, laparoscopy, otoscopy, and other procedure types.And on the basis of end user the market is divided into veterinary clinic, veterinary hospitals and other end users.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05833629/?utm_source=PRNAbout ReportlinkerReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene.

It was not known if the patient had suffered a relapse or was re-infected, but genetic sequencing suggests the virus relapsed in the patient, the WHO said.\n\"The majority of recent cases are coming from a single chain of transmission that is linked to a suspected relapse of EVD in an individual,\" the WHO said. \"Although this has led to a number of secondary cases, efforts are being made to closely monitor the cases and their contacts to reduce the risk of tertiary transmission. It is thus of paramount importance that all areas of response are functional and fully resourced to bring an end to this outbreak.\" Dec 17 WHO situation report\nWHO details November MERS cases in Saudi Arabia\nThe WHO today offered new details on 10 MERS-CoV cases recorded in Saudi Arabia in November, half of which were connected to camels.\nThe cases were reported in six different regions, and five involved contact with camels or camel products, a known risk factor for MERS-COV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection. Four cases were recorded in Riyadh, two in Medina, and one each in Mecca, Taif, Asir, and Al Qassim.\nAll the patients were men, and none were health workers or secondary cases. One patient, a 38-year-old man from Riyadh, died from his infection.\nThe WHO said that, from 2012 through Nov 30, 2019, a total of 2,494 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases and 858 associated deaths have been recorded, the vast majority in Saudi Arabia. Dec 18 WHO update\nInexpensive paper-based test detects Lyme bacteria in early stages\nA new inexpensive paper-based test can detect antibodies against the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium in serum samples, which means it could quickly and accurately identify Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness that affects up to 300,000 American each year. The test is meant for use in the first 30 days after a tick bite, when the telltale \"bull's eye\" rash may or may not appear.\nAuthors writing in the journal ACS Nano describe the point-of-care (POC) handheld test as containing a sensing membrane for bacterial antigens and a synthetic peptide. If B burgdorferi bacteria are present, the antigen spots turn different colors. Results appear within 15 minutes.\nFifty blood samples from people with and without early-stage Lyme disease were tested using the paper-based device, and the assay showed a specificity of 96.3% and sensitivity of 85.7%.\nCurrent two-tier tests for Lyme disease catch only 50% of Lyme cases in early stages, the authors said, and cost more than $400 per test, with results typically read in more than 1 day. The new paper-based test costs $0.42 per test.\n\"The multitarget and portable POC nature of the computational xVFA [multiplexed vertical flow assay] make it uniquely suited for [Lyme] diagnostics, presenting major advantages in terms of time, cost, and performance when compared to (first-tier) EIAs [enzyme immunoassays] with single antigen targets as well as standard two-tier testing methods that are rather costly ( e . g ., >$400/test) and slow (>24 h for results),\" the authors conclude.

Part 2 covers other viral illnesses, including flu.\nRunny nose? Cough? Sore throat?\nYour child might be dealing with the common cold.\nBelow, Dr. Patrick Grathwohl, a pediatrician in Steamboat Springs and a member of the medical staff at UCHealth Yampa Valley Medical Center, outlines six things to know about colds and your child. Colds can be constant\nThere’s a reason these colds are called common.\n“Under age 6, it is not uncommon for children to have up to eight colds per year and one per month from late fall to early spring,” Grathwohl said.\nSince each individual cold can last up to two weeks, and most kids have symptoms for more than 10 days, it’s possible for children to have a runny nose and cough much of the fall, winter and spring.\nBut there is a silver lining. “As children get older, the number and duration of colds will often decrease,” Grathwohl said. Colds cause congestion\nThe main symptom of a cold is nasal congestion, with clear, yellow or green mucus. Fever is common in the first few days of infection. Children may also have a sore throat, cough and enlarged lymph nodes and may be more irritable and have a decreased appetite.\nAbout two-thirds of children who have a cold also have a cough.\n“The cough is often the most concerning symptom to parents,” Grathwohl said. “Coughs can affect sleep, play, school performance and more. Coughs will usually linger for one to two weeks after other symptoms recede but should improve gradually over time.” Rhinovirus cause\nThe rhinovirus, which has more than 100 different subtypes, is the virus responsible for most cases of colds. Other viruses that can cause colds include enterovirus and coronavirus.\nWhile these viruses are more common in colder times, they are not caused by cold climates or cold air.\nThey typically spread by direct contact.\n“Some can remain infectious on hard surfaces for up to one day, and direct droplet transmission can occur from coughing or breathing in proximity of others,” Grathwohl said. A doctor visit may be necessary\nBabies younger than 4 months old should be seen by a primary care provider for any cold symptoms. Children who also have labored breathing, a high fever and vomiting should be seen by a primary care provider.\n“Monitor your child for signs and symptoms of dehydration,” Grathwohl said. “The most common sign is a decrease in urination or wet diapers.” Colds can result in other infections\nSinus infections, which come with facial pressure and headache, may crop up after a cold. About 20% of children with a cold will also get a bacterial ear infection. And pneumonia may also arise.\n“Usually, children with a secondary infection will develop a fever after the first three days of cold symptoms,” Grathwohl said. “Those with pneumonia will often have labored or rapid breathing and sometimes vomiting.” Cold medicines aren’t for kids\n“Treatment for children is often different than for adults,” Grathwohl said. “We do not recommend antihistamines, decongestants, cough medicines or expectorants in children, but these could possibly be beneficial for some older kids and adolescents on a case-by-case basis.”\nGrathwohl recommends using saline nose drops or saline spray and suctioning the nose when needed. Honey may help with coughing but can only be given to children older than 1. Besides helping your child stay comfortable, make sure he or she is drinking enough.\n“Hydration should be a main area of focus for parents with most illnesses, including colds,” Grathwohl said.\nSusan Cunningham writes for UCHealth Yampa Valley Medical Center.

DUNLEAVY The horrors associated with a worldwide pandemic are arguably unimaginable. However, thanks to a team of experts at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University we don’t have to dream up doomsday scenarios. And, hopefully, because of their enterprising work—including the staging of global preparedness exercises—we may be better able to respond to eventualities such as a worldwide epidemic of an infectious disease.“Our exercises are primarily educational tools,” Eric Toner, MD, senior scholar with the Center for Health Security and a Senior Scientist in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, told Contagion ®. “One of things we try to demonstrate through these exercises are economic and societal consequences, as well as the public health consequences, of a severe pandemic. We want to show policymakers, business leaders, and global public health organizations that a severe pandemic may be as disruptive to a country as a national security event can be.” For its most recent “exercise,” called Event 201 which was held in New York City in October, the Center for Health Security partnered with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to engage 15 leaders in business, government, and public health to model response to a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. At the start of the exercise, the world was 3 months in, and there were already more than 500,000 cases globally. By its end, worldwide leaders were faced with a pandemic that involved more than 10 million cases, with the disease spreading rapidly through low-income districts of “mega-cities” around the world. Governments had issued travel bans, crippling the global travel and tourism industries. Thanks to these and other factors, the global economy was in “freefall,” with financial markets in tatters. Of course, this was a worst-case scenario—but, sadly and most concerning, it is all too realistic. According to Toner, we only need think back less than 20 years, to events such as the 2003 SARS or the 2005 H5N1 bird flu outbreaks, or the influenza pandemic in 2009 to see the potential for global catastrophe. During Event 201, as in these real-world cases, the challenges included resolving the economic issues while ensuring health care services—and antivirals—were available and accessible to those who needed them.“All these events have led to growing awareness of the potential challenges,” Toner noted, “but unfortunately we’ve seen that among policymakers and business leaders this awareness waxes and wanes. The response to all the exercises we’ve done have been encouraging.” Which is why the “Pandemic Emergency Board” convened for the Event 2001 included representatives from the UN Foundation, the World Bank, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Central Intelligence Agency, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as leaders from the travel, banking, pharmaceutical, and healthcare services industries.“Outbreaks of infectious disease are inevitable, but the economic damage they cause is not,” Ryan Morhard, project lead for Global Health Security, World Economic Forum said in a statement provided by the Center for Health Security. “Sustained attention from a broad multi-stakeholder coalition is needed in advance of a severe pandemic to save lives and minimize economic and societal consequences.” And, as Toner noted, demonstrating how to prepare for a specific type of biosecurity event—whether it involves the accidental release of a dangerous pathogen, the intentional release of a bioweapon, or a naturally occurring disease pandemic, as recreated during Event 201—helps the global community prepare for all of them. Creating models such as Event 201 takes more than a year of planning, and an investment of “hundreds of thousands of dollars”, he said, but the lessons learned are invaluable.“We think that for a severe pandemic, you need both the public and private sectors to be involved, as well as civil society,” Toner added. “The expertise may exist in the public sector, but the resources are most often found in the private sector. When epidemics happen, these stakeholders do find ways to work together, but it’s never easy or particularly efficient. We think by working more closely in the preparedness phase, these stakeholders will be more able to work effect together in the response phase in the future.” To stay informed on the latest in infectious disease news and developments, please sign up for our weekly newsletter.

Credit: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty LEBANON: Classes, as well as clashes, in the streets\nMona Fawaz\nLebanon’s ongoing financial meltdown and the political dysfunction behind it have fuelled large protests across the country. Since October, everyday life has been disrupted and classes suspended. The challenges are acute because of the country’s location in a region of recurrent wars and refugee crises. One flashpoint has been the loss of public spaces in cities, sacrificed to rampant privatization that is turning Beirut into a playground for the rich.\nAs a researcher into progressive city planning, I consider that my work should be driven by immediate realities.\nBooks for our time: seven classics that speak to us now\nDespite the daily difficulties, I have discovered a new creativity in the occupation of abandoned theatres, car parks, city streets and public squares, which serve as forums for open debates about timely topics. We discuss, for example, the significance of public spaces for political transformation and financial schemes that render land and housing unaffordable for urban majorities. I reframe questions, articulate methods and reconsider what is taken for granted. Inspired also by the soup kitchens, free psychiatric clinics and artistic performances that are reclaiming central Beirut, I assigned my students to devising institutional planning mechanisms to support the restoration of the city’s historic core as a shared space. My research will continue to document transgressive practices and seek to inform city planners’ conception of common good, urban citizenship and collective property ownership. VENEZUELA: Safety, then science\nBenjamin R. Scharifker\nScientists need freedom and personal safety to work and pursue the truth — not propaganda, ideologies, post-truth politics and alternative facts. As Venezuela enters its third decade of socio-economic and political upheaval, this year’s waves of unrest have further obstructed the serious pursuit of science in my country. This will change only when the complex humanitarian emergency afflicting us today is resolved.\nScience struggles on in my ravaged country\nScientific activity in Venezuela expanded during the second half of the twentieth century, when the country enjoyed relative political and economic stability. Migratory inflows, mostly from Europe and Latin America, favoured the emergence and consolidation of academic institutions. As the authoritarian pretensions of Hugo Chávez’s regime took hold, I became involved in the management of two important universities — the Simón Bolivar University and the Metropolitan University, both in the capital, Caracas — in an attempt to build on this research base. The regime of Nicolás Maduro is now close to achieving its goal of disbanding academic research.\nThe Venezuelan economy has shrunk by two-thirds in the past four years. Shortages of electricity, water, food and medicines have driven around 13% of the population out of the country — the largest refugee crisis in the history of the Americas. My electrochemistry laboratory limps on with just a handful of students. BOLIVIA: Creativity fell to zero, papers lay unwritten\nMónica Moraes R.\nAfter 14 years of increasingly authoritarian government, a disputed election plunged Bolivia into crisis this autumn. Amid protests, strikes, violence, vandalism, and shortages of fuel and food, research was suspended for more than a month.\nWith such uncertainty, concentration and abstraction stand no chance. Between silent days and those punctuated by explosions, we put the planning of classes and field trips on hold to keep students and support staff safe. Opportunities were lost for gathering data on our biodiversity, and still need to be rescheduled. Distraction was total, creativity fell to zero and research papers lay unwritten.\nMy greatest hope is that normality will soon return, particularly to everyday science, so that we can rebuild our confidence and country with a new vision. SUDAN: Empty labs fair price for fresh start\nMuntaser E. Ibrahim\nSudan’s political crisis, triggered by government austerity measures imposed a year ago to fend off economic collapse, has sunk the country’s mechanisms for learning and research into recession. University gates are shut and laboratories lie empty. The country’s young professionals — including doctors, teachers, lawyers, university staff and students — consider this a fair price to pay as they call for a fresh beginning that they demand should be based on the triad of revolutionary concepts: freedom, peace and justice.\nSudanese academics defiant as revolution turns bloody\nLast summer, this peaceful pro-democracy group brought president Omar al-Bashir’s repressive 30-year regime to its knees. The ousted government had inaugurated its reign by launching an anti-science campaign (see Nature 348 , 5; 1990 ). One example was the notorious persecution of Farouk Ibrahim, a professor at the University of Khartoum, for teaching evolutionary theory. The latest protests have helped to redeem Ibrahim and end the system of corruption. IRAN: Homegrown science can rise above sanctions\nSharif Moradi\nIn November, Iran experienced nationwide protests against a government decision to ration petrol and raise its price. Sanctions are among the factors blamed for fuelling the nation’s economic and other woes (see, for example, Nature 574 , 13–14; 2019 ). Although sanctions since 1979 have been punishing, they have helped to promote homegrown scientific enterprises. For example, Iranian researchers are now producing pharmaceuticals (such as stem-cell treatments for blood diseases, and recombinant chemotherapy drugs), biological research materials and diagnostic kits. Instead of pinning its hopes on international negotiations, I believe that the government should be focusing on the immense potential of its highly educated people and its plentiful natural resources for making products that are in short supply.\nSuccessive governments in Iran have expressed strong interest in research and development, but they need to spend much more on research to realize its potential — currently this amounts to roughly 0.6% of gross domestic product.\nTo move forward, Iranian researchers must cultivate their social capital. They should design joint projects with their peers, exchange students with other countries and strengthen connections between academia and industry. When a nation is subject to economic pressure, projects should address crucial local needs. And people should be encouraged to donate money to fund science. ECUADOR: Campus food drive through the barricades\nErnesto Medina\nAcademia in Ecuador, already under stress in our struggling economy, was dealt another blow by the civil unrest in October 2019 over more austerity measures. It reportedly caused the country losses of tens of millions of US dollars. Most universities were hit by the protests, which paralysed travel and resulted in shortages of food, fuel and medical supplies for almost two weeks. Barricades allowed no access to labs, so experimental research ground to a halt.\nAttacks on scholars worldwide raise concern\nMy own institution, Yachay Tech — one of Ecuador’s first research-intensive universities — was protected, however, because most students and many staff members live on campus. The authorities, faculty and administrative employees set up a food drive through temporary barricade openings.\nBetter still, it has been announced that our budget will be increased for 2020, so there will be new job opportunities for researchers. Orders for research equipment have finally come through.\nIn spite of all the difficulties, we are now in a good position to consolidate the university’s standing in research: Yachay Tech is currently at the top of the Nature Index for Ecuador and among the top 20 institutions in the production of Scopus-indexed articles in the country. SYRIA: Adversity sows resilience\nWasim Maziak\nAs the director of the Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies, the civil unrest in Lebanon this autumn reminded me of the upheaval that rocked my home country in 2011, which forced me to move all my research from Aleppo to Beirut. The growing instability in the region amplified my doubts about investing more time in collaborative research, and highlighted the irony of planning research in countries where all aspects of life are hijacked by corrupt and authoritarian regimes. But I pressed on, branching out in my research from a focus on tobacco control to topics related to humanitarian needs.\nTo do that amid the extreme cruelty of war is not easy. It demanded that I dig out all the resilience strategies that I have learnt working in unstable circumstances. Relying on local scientists and distant mentorship, building contingency plans and choosing efficient study designs are some of the tips I can offer here. I am also reminded that humanitarian research is critical to bring the suffering of ordinary people, trapped in these painful twists of history, to the attention of the outside world. The hope is that once representative political systems are in place, these seeds will jump-start the collaborations needed to steer effective health solutions.

Last month, it found its way into universities: protesters occupied campuses, staff and students were forced to evacuate, and classes were suspended.\nViolent clashes at Hong Kong universities disrupt research\nMany students fled. Research laboratories were abruptly shut down, experiments came to a halt, and animal and other facilities were closed. I feared that this situation would drag on, but for my university the disruption was fortunately short-lived.\nHong Kong’s scientific research has always been conducted by a complement of local and international researchers. The disturbances have affected our recruitment of talent, especially of postgraduate students. Applications from students on the mainland are expected to plummet. Some newly appointed professors are thinking twice about coming to join us in Hong Kong.\nUniversities should be sites of innovation, where we find solutions for problems — including those of socio-political systems. My university identified the SARS coronavirus in 2003, and our research remained strong despite the global financial crisis in 2008 and the Umbrella Movement protests in 2014. I remain optimistic that our extensive scientific research collaborations with academic institutions in China will continue in spite of the current upheavals. Demonstrators mark the deaths of 23 people killed in the riots over the previous 10 days in Santiago, Chile, in November 2019. Credit: Claudio Reyes/AFP/Getty CHILE: want social justice? Spend on science\nCecilia Hidalgo\nIt is hard to argue for stronger support for science in Chile’s current situation of civil unrest, sparked by this year’s legitimate protests for social justice that have led to shocking human-rights violations and deplorable violence (see Nature 575 , 265–266; 2019 ). Yet critical situations can present an opportunity for improvement. As president of Chile’s Academy of Sciences, I contend that more investment in research will help in the understanding and correction of social injustices and will accelerate the country’s long-term development.\nWhat the protests and violence in Chile mean for science\nTo achieve an equitable society, Chile needs to advance the generation of knowledge in all areas — including the natural and social sciences, the arts and the humanities. It must urgently address water scarcity arising from the climate-change-driven desertification of much of the country; the childhood obesity epidemic; the challenges of dealing with a population that is ageing at developed-world rates but with developing-world health care; and the factors fuelling the current social unrest.\nThese problems require science-based solutions. That means markedly increasing Chile’s funding of science, technology and innovation from its present meagre level of 0.36% of gross domestic product. CATALONIA: Science rises above riots\nJoan Martínez Alier\nOctober saw riots in Catalonia — the latest of several waves of demonstrations that have taken place over the past two years demanding complete autonomy from Spain. Many university students were on strike, but like other researchers, I could still access my offices.\nViews from a continent in flux\nIn my view, Catalonia’s history of unresolved political tensions has not damaged its recent progress in science. The foundations seem strong: for example, the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies has contributed substantially to the quality of new research institutes and some university departments since 2001. Moreover, Catalonia holds fourth place — ahead of Spain — among member countries of the European Research Area for the number of European Research Council grants per million inhabitants (see go.nature.com/2pgfbed ).\nI believe that investment in Catalonia’s science could increase considerably should independence be obtained from Spain after an agreed referendum. One reason is that fiscal transfers to Spain, which amount to about €2,000 (US$2,226) per capita each year, would stop. Another is that pro-independence parties explicitly believe in the potential competitive advantage of science in Catalonia.\nNature 576 , 382-384 (2019)", "external_links": [], "published": "2019-12-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-17T17:20:17.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

What is bentonite clay and what are its health benefits? Here's why bentonite clay can be good for you! By: Sandhya Raghavan | | Published: April 24, 2017 4:39 pm Tags: Clay Health benefits Stomach\nDoes the idea of eating clay sound disgusting to you? What if we told you, that consuming clay has its therapeutic benefits? But not just any clay, we are talking about the healing bentonite clay. In the recent years, the health and beauty industries have focused their attention on this power-packed clay and are rediscovering its many benefits. With it super absorbent, toxin-pulling abilities, Bentonite clay is now on its way to becoming the next best health trend in the years to come. What is bentonite clay? Bentonite is a highly absorbent aluminium phyllosilicate clay that is comprised mostly of montmorillonite. It is named after the place where it was first discovered in North America, near Cretaceous Benton Shale in Wyoming. How does it work? Bentonite clay is superabsorbent in nature and gets supercharged with electrical energy when it comes in contact with water. It creates a strong negative charge which helps in attracting the positively charged heavy metals and toxins, purging it out of the system. That’s why it is recommended that the clay is never mixed or stored in metal containers. It will lose its charge and draw toxins from the metals. It is antimicrobial Bentonite clay has antimicrobial properties [1]. Therefore, it can be used to cure and soothe infectious skin conditions that result from microbial infections. Bentonite skin is best used as a clay mask for the skin. This powerful clay is best mixed with apple cider vinegar and applied directly to the skin. The absorbent nature of the clay ensures that the toxins and sebum from the pores are pulled out. So it is great for those with chronic acne . Infections skin problems such as dermatitis , eczema and psoriasis can be soothed by applying a layer of the soothing clay on the skin. [2] It is good for stomach In a study conducted in 1998 [3], bentonite clay showed promising results in removing rotavirus and coronavirus toxins from the guts of mammals; both the viruses are responsible for many gastrointestinal problems. Food grade (non-food grade clay may contain lead) bentonite clay can, therefore, be safely consumed to relieve gastrointestinal problems. [3] By clearing toxins from the stomach, the clay aids in the proliferation of good stomach bacteria.

The trial is a collaboration between the Jenner Institute and the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. MERS-CoV causes an emerging zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) viral respiratory disease that was first described in 2012 and is now endemic in KSA. MERS-CoV infection can be asymptomatic or can result in severe acute respiratory distress and death.\nMERS-CoV has spread to different countries in the Middle East and other regions with 2458 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 851 deaths in 27 countries reported, as of September 2019. MERS-CoV poses a significant threat to public health security based on its epidemic potential and lack of currently available effective countermeasures and has been listed as a priority pathogen for research and development by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health agencies around the globe.\nDromedary camels are now recognised as the source of zoonotic infections. In one study 54.9% of primary cases were associated with direct camel exposure. Human to human transmission, especially in hospitals, has been responsible for the majority of cases seen in recent outbreaks.\nThe Phase I trial in KSA will replicate the design of the initial study performed in Oxford. In the Oxford trial of the ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine, 24 healthy adult volunteers aged 18-50 years received a single dose of vaccine with the aim of assessing safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS. ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to induce immune responses against MERS-CoV.\nIt is hoped that the trial in KSA will provide additional data to support these findings, and conducting a clinical trial in a disease endemic region is an important step in vaccine development. A vaccine against MERS-CoV could be used to prevent zoonotic transmission, especially in those frequently exposed to camels in the Middle East, to immunise healthcare workers in regions where hospital outbreaks have occurred or to respond to an outbreak in a healthcare setting or community.\nProfessor Sarah Gilbert, UK project leader and Professor of Vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, said: ’I congratulate KAIMRC on starting the first phase I clinical trial of a novel vaccine ever to take place in Saudi Arabia. It is appropriate that the trial is of a vaccine against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. I look forward to continuing the fruitful collaboration between the Jenner Institute at Oxford University and KAIMRC.’\nNaif Alharbi, vaccinologist and Co-PI on the Saudi MERS vaccine trial, said: ’I am honoured to lead the Oxford-KAIMRC collaboration that is now making historical progress as we are starting the first ever phase I clinical trial in Saudi Arabia for this vaccine. It is essential that we conduct phase I trials for MERS vaccines in Saudi Arabia where MERS-CoV is endemic and considered a national health research priority. I am also thrilled to have worked on the vaccine from lab and mice testing in Oxford and then to have been leading its development in camels and humans in Saudi Arabia. This trial will pave the way to further development of MERS vaccines. This trial also comes in time with our recent successful completion of evaluating the same vaccine in a camels in Saudi Arabia.’\nMohammad Bosaeed, ID consultant and PI on the Saudi MERS vaccine trial, said: ’It is a great pleasure to lead the MERS vaccine phase I clinical trial, first ever Saudi phase I trial. We have also recently received approval for a state of the art clinical trial unit in our hospital (At the Saudi National Guard Health Affairs), first of its kind in the country. We are now recruiting for the study which assesses safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-MERS vaccine in healthy subjects in Saudi Arabia. I have no doubt that this great milestone would open the doors for more clinical trials both in KAIMRC and in Saudi Arabia; we are excited and grateful for collaborating with Oxford University.’\nAbout the trial The trial will take place in King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC) and King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), both are under the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (Saudi NGHA). KAMC in Riyadh has been recognised as a distinguished healthcare provider in Saudi Arabia and the region, with a bed capacity of 1501, commenced its operations in May 1983. Since then, it has continued expanding, while providing services for a rapidly growing patient population in all of its catchments areas. Recently KAIMRC and KAMC has received approval for phase I clinical trial unit from the national regulator (Saudi FDA).\nSituation of MERS-CoV At the end of September 2019, a total of 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 851 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.4%) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (2077 cases, including 773 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 37.2%).The number of cases reported in KSA this year was more than 2018, but significantly less than the 2014-2017 corresponding period.\"In one study 54.9% of primary cases were associated with direct camel exposure.\" Ref: Reported Direct and Indirect Contact with Dromedary Camels among Laboratory-Confirmed MERS-CoV Cases. Conzade R et al. (Viruses. 2018 Aug 13;10(8). PMID: 30104551).\nFuture development of the vaccine will be funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition that aims to derail epidemics by speeding up the development of vaccines. CEPI will fund the vaccine for public health use. The commercial rights to the vaccine are held by Vaccitech a University of Oxford spin out company.

Those peacekeepers have been entering the country without any health screening for a long time.\nThe division also said that none of the health desks at the eight international land crossings are functional due to a crunch of budget and human resources.\nThe World Health Organization says high traffic can play a crucial role in the spread of deadly diseases internationally.\nHealth experts say the closure of the only functioning health desk at the country’s sole international airport, which receives around 10,000 international passengers daily, is a dangerous thing.\n\"This is a very unfortunate thing,\" Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert, told the Post. \"This could bring huge consequences, like an international blockade, in case of an outbreak of diseases.\"\nSetting up health desks at international entry points—international airports and overland crossings— is the responsibility of the government, as Nepal is a member state of the International Health Regulation, and has committed to responding and preventing public health risk.\nSetting up health desks and strengthening them with equipment and trained human resources are parts of the commitment.\n\"Instead of strengthening the health desks, the government let them shut down,\" he said. \"What can be more unfortunate than this.\"\nArjun Poudel is a health reporter for The Kathmandu Post.

The outbreak was likely tied to international travel between Samoa and New Zealand, and fears over the vaccine grew in 2018 after two babies in Samoa died when their vaccinations were incorrectly mixed.\nA vaccination coverage rate of 95% or higher is needed to prevent outbreaks. Dec 2 Washington Post article\nReview highlights role of asymptomatic MERS in human transmission\nNew research conducted by World Health Organization (WHO) investigators highlights the potential threat of asymptomatic, human-to-human MERS-CoV transmission.\nIn a paper published late last week in Epidemiologic Reviews, WHO researchers aimed to get a better understanding of human-to-human spread of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), particularly the role that asymptomatic or subclinical infections play in transmission. They conducted a systematic review of 43 studies published from 2012 through 2018 and of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported to the WHO since 2012.\nTwenty-three of the studies reported evidence of MERS-CoV infection outside of healthcare settings, mainly of camel workers, showing ranges of seroprevalence of 0% to 67% depending on the study location; 20 studies involved healthcare settings, healthcare workers, and family contacts, of which 11 showed molecular evidence of infection among asymptomatic contacts. In addition, the researchers identified 298 lab-confirmed cases reported as asymptomatic to the WHO, 164 of whom involved healthcare workers.\nAlthough the studies conducted in healthcare settings did not investigate onward transmission, they did capture evidence of RNA shedding, which suggests human-to-human transmission is possible from people who have no signs or symptoms of infection. The authors of the review say this finding reinforces the evidence that healthcare workers are more likely to be at risk of MERS-CoV infection due to close unprotected contact with MERS patients before their diagnosis, and they present a silent risk of human-to-human transmission.\nWhile screening of healthcare worker contacts of confirmed MERS-CoV patients is currently recommended, the authors suggest systematic screening of non-healthcare worker contacts should also be encouraged. Nov 29 Epidemiol Rev abstract\nThe study was published on the same day that Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a MERS case involving a 48-year-old man in Medina, located in the western part of the country. The MOH investigation found that the man had contact with camels, and his MERS-CoV exposure is classified as primary, meaning he probably wasn't exposed to another patient. The case was the eleventh reported by Saudi Arabia in November, compared with 14 in October and 4 in September.\nAs of the end of October, the WHO has received reports of 2,482 cases, at least 854 of them fatal. Saudi Arabia has been by far the hardest-hit country. Nov 29 Saudi MOH report\nH5N6 avian flu reported for first time in Arica\nThe H5N6 strain of avian flu has been confirmed for the first time in Africa, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reported last week.\nNigerian veterinary officials said the low-pathogenic form of the disease was confirmed at a livestock market in an outbreak that began in June. Among a flock of 2,449 birds at the live-bird market, 150 were infected but none died, according to a Nov 27 OIE report. The strain was detected during active surveillance.\nThe market is in Sokoto province in the northwest. Healthy birds will be quarantined and the premises disinfected, Nigerian officials said.\nHighly pathogenic H5N6 viruses first emerged in China in 2013 and have since been reported in birds in several Asian nations. The strain has also caused 19 human infections and 6 deaths in China, according to the WHO A highly pathogenic H5N6 variant emerged in 2017 and caused outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in Asia and Europe. The OIE report does not specify the origin of the Nigerian virus. Nov 27 OIE Nigeria report\nElsewhere, highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu was detected in chickens at a slaughterhouse in Taipai City, Taiwan, according to a separate OIE report.\nThe virus was detected in 1 of 11 susceptible poultry in an outbreak that began on Nov 13. The strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction on Nov 14 and by gene sequencing on Nov 15 at Taiwan's national lab. Since 2015 Taiwan has confirmed dozens of H5N2 outbreaks.

The cases were reported from Assir (5 cases), Al-Qassim (3 cases), Riyadh (6 cases), and Taif (1 case) regions. Of the 15 cases reported, four were linked to two separate clusters. Cluster 1 involved a patient (case #1) and a health care worker (case #5) in Assir region. Cluster 2 involved a patient (case #12) and a health care worker (case #15) in Riyadh region.\nThe link below provides details of the 15 reported cases: xls, 122kb\nSince 2012 until 31 October 2019, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2484, with 857 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states. WHO risk assessment\nInfection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.\nThe notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting or household contacts).\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO advice\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.\nEarly identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\nMERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

And, they endure it all without a fully developed immune system.\nIt’s no wonder calves are more susceptible to illness at weaning. But, preventative strategies, like proper cattle respiratory vaccines, prepare a calf to better fight off disease challenges.\nConsider these tips as you evaluate your cattle vaccination schedule: 1. Determine vaccines needed\nStart by ensuring you are using the cattle vaccines necessary to protect your calves. Work with your veterinarian to determine the right animal health protocol for your calves.\nA combination of an intranasal respiratory, a bacterial pneumonia and a 5-way viral cattle respiratory vaccine can help prevent common respiratory diseases like Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), Parainfluenza 3 (PI-3), Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus and more.\nClostridial diseases, although uncommon, come with a poor prognosis. Calves are often diagnosed with clostridial diseases after it’s too late for intervention. A 7-way clostridial cattle vaccine can help prevent costly diseases, like black leg, malignant edema, black disease and more.\nYour veterinarian is your best partner in developing a comprehensive animal health protocol – make sure you’re having proactive discussions about vaccination programs. 2. Strategize your cattle vaccination schedule\nThe timing strategy outlined here allows calves to respond to vaccinations while they’re on pasture, before weaning-time stress begins. Consider your specific herd dynamics and challenges before determining a cattle vaccination schedule.\nAt birth: Oral scour vaccine for pathogens like rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli Clostridial vaccine Ultimately, the best “vaccine” at birth is high-quality colostrum from the calf’s dam\nAt tagging or branding (2-4 months old): Intranasal cattle respiratory vaccine Bacterial pneumonia vaccine for Pasteurella and Mannhaemia Haemolytica +/- BVD\nPreweaning/weaning (2-4 weeks before weaning, with a booster during weaning): 7-way clostridial vaccine 5-way viral cattle respiratory vaccine Bacterial pneumonia vaccine for Pasteurella and Mannhaemia Haemolytica\nNo matter your cattle vaccination schedule, aim to vaccinate calves during low-stress periods, so their immune systems are better equipped to elicit an immune response. 3. Review cattle vaccine best practices\nHuman error is the most common cause of vaccine failure in non-stressed cattle. Take time to prepare and follow proper vaccine protocols. Always read and follow label directions to ensure vaccines are administered at the recommended dose and route and in a site that minimizes carcass defects. Follow cattle vaccination schedule recommendations for proper intervals between vaccinations. If administering multiple vaccines, never mix two different products in one syringe. Clean and sanitize your equipment before each use. Water heated to 180 degrees Fahrenheit should be used to clean pistol grip syringes. After washing, ensure syringes are free from residual disinfectant that may inactivate vaccines, and replace your needles after 10 to 15 injections. Follow vaccine storage best practices by avoiding exposure to direct sunlight or freezing temperatures. Most cattle vaccines should be stored at 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit and should be kept in an insulated cooler during administration. Vaccines shouldn’t be saved. Purchase cattle vaccine quantities to use all at once. If using modified live vaccines, administer within one hour of opening the bottle.\nLook to your local veterinarian for more vaccination best practices. 4. Ensure proper nutrition\nAn overlooked aspect of a vaccination program is the calf’s ability to elicit an immune response. If a calf can’t elicit an immune response to the vaccination, it does no good. Calves equipped to elicit a proper immune response to a vaccination are protected against disease.\nHigh-quality weaned calf rations, like the Purina ® starter line with RX3 ™ Immune Support Technology , support immune function to complement cattle respiratory vaccines.\nPlan now to combat costly respiratory challenges with strong starter feeds.\nDoes your cattle nutrition program stack up?

New advanced vaccines have been manufactured, which contain genetically engineered components derived from those disease agents. They are given to pigs, usually by injection, to stimulate an immune response which will protect the pigs against later natural infection with the organism from which the vaccine was derived.\nMost of the vaccines stimulate both a humoral response and a cell-mediated response. Vaccines can be live, containing living organisms which will multiply in the pig, or inactivated, containing only killed organisms which will not multiply in the pig. As there is a need for novel vaccines against all the disease-causing pathogens, there is a rapid increase in the R&D expenditure, which drives the vaccine segment to expand its reach to a broad spectrum of diseases.\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate over the Forecast Period\nNorth America is expected to dominate the market due to the rising incidence of swine infections, such as Swine Enteric Coronavirus Diseases (SECD), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDv), porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), which has caused significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.\nThe virus is endemic in swine populations in North America. In the United States, the Swine Health Protection Act (SHPA) regulates the meat products fed to swine. Compliance with this act ensures that all food waste fed to swine is properly treated to kill disease organisms. Raw meat may transmit numerous infectious or communicable diseases to swine. Over the forecast period, with the rise in the incidence of swine, the US is expected to be a major revenue-generating region for the swine health market.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe market players in the swine health market are involving in various growth strategies such as collaborations, partnerships, agreements, mergers, and acquisitions in order to enhance the market presence. For instance, in 2018 Elanco Animal Health introduced Prevacent PRRS, a modified-live respiratory vaccine for reduction of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), respiratory form, in piglets two weeks or older. In May 2019, MSD Animal Health has launched its Porcilis Ery+Parvo+Lepto combination vaccine for pigs.\nKey Topics Covered", "external_links": ["https://researchandmarkets.com/reports/4833390/swine-healthcare-market-growth-trends-and?utm_source=dynamic&utm_medium=BW&utm_code=m2k3zh&utm_campaign=1327896+-+Outlook+on+the+World%27s+Swine+Healthcare+Market%2c+2019-2024+-+Increasing+Investments+in+R%26D+Activities+to+Develop+Novel+Therapeutics&utm_exec=joca220bwd", "https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4833390/swine-healthcare-market-growth-trends-and", "https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4833390/swine-healthcare-market-growth-trends-and?utm_source=dynamic&utm_medium=BW&utm_code=m2k3zh&utm_campaign=1327896+-+Outlook+on+the+World%27s+Swine+Healthcare+Market%2c+2019-2024+-+Increasing+Investments+in+R%26D+Activities+to+Develop+Novel+Therapeutics&utm_exec=joca220bwd"], "published": "2019-12-04T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-05T10:51:16.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial viru s (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida , Mannheimia haemolytica , Histophilus somni , Mycoplasma bovis , in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented . Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica , M. bovis , P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.

The market is estimated to grow with a CAGR of 6.7% from 2019-2027.\nRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05833629/?utm_source=PRN\nThe key factors that are driving the growth of veterinary endoscopes market are increasing pet animal's population, growing training programs for endoscopic diagnosis and rising incidences of zoonotic diseases over the forecasted years. Also, the growth opportunities in the developing nations are likely to have a positive impact on the growth of the market in the coming years.Zoonotic diseases are an infectious disease which is transmitted to humans through vertebrate animals.The zoonotic diseases further three major types, such as endemic zoonoses, epidemic zoonoses, and emerging and re-emerging zoonoses.Among these types of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are emerging and showing increasing incidences in various geographic areas.For instance, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is stated that nearly 61% of the human pathogens are zoonotic.Diseases such as Rift Valley fever, SARS, pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, Yellow fever, Avian Influenza (H5N1), and (H7N9), West Nile virus are zoonotic.In addition, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was increased rapidly in recent years, was caused by a zoonotic pathogen.Moreover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is stated that approximately ten thousand Americans are estimated to get affected by zoonotic diseases.The major source for transmission of diseases is animals consumed, such as goat meat, beef, pork, chicken, and others.According to the CDC, it is stated that six out of ten infectious diseases in people are zoonotic diseases. Thus, owing to the rising incidences and risk of the zoonotic diseases are likely to drive the growth of veterinary endoscopes during the forecast period.The veterinary endoscopes market is segmented on the basis of product type, application, procedures and end user.The market based on product type segment is classified as capsule endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and rigid endoscopes.On the basis application the market is segmented as diagnostic and surgical.Based on the procedure the market is classified as bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, gastrointestinal, laparoscopy, otoscopy, and other procedure types.And on the basis of end user the market is divided into veterinary clinic, veterinary hospitals and other end users.About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Almost every single district has gotten either increased influenza-like illness visits to their physician, or they’re seeing laboratory confirmed specimens,” Ingram said.\nAlabama has not reached peak flu season, which typically comes between December and January, but Ingram says now is the time to prepare.\n“The number one thing is of course getting the flu vaccine. That is the single most way you can prevent getting the flu. Of course, wash your hands, that’s a really big thing,” Ingram said.\nIt’s not too late to get the flu vaccine. Some pharmacies and doctors offices still have signs up urging patients to walk in.\n“We always recommend anytime during flu season to get the flu vaccine,” Ingram said.\nInfluenza is not the only illness spreading across the state. There are a variety of illnesses that are spreading, including Metapneumovirus, Corona virus, and paraenfluenza.\n“We also have six other respiratory viruses that we have identified and the specimens that are being sent to the state labs, so its not just flu,” Ingram said.\nWhich means washing your hands and covering your cough will go a long way in making sure you’re not spreading diseases. Young children and adults over the age of 65 run a greater risk of catching the flu. Ungram says it is vital for those age groups to get the vaccine so they are better protected..\nThe CDC estimates there have been more than 2 million flu cases that have resulted in at least 1,300 deaths this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2019-12-18T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-18T02:54:40.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She developed fever, cough, shortness of breath and headache on 23 November 2019, and presented to a hospital on 25 November. On 27 November, she went to the same hospital for follow up. However, on 28 November, her condition worsened and she was admitted to the hospital. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 28 November and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse- 29 November. The patient had underlying medical conditions, and passed away on 12 December 2019. The source of her infection is under investigation. The patient had neither a history of contact with dromedary camels nor recent travel. Follow up and screening of seven household contacts and 40 healthcare worker contacts is ongoing and two asymptomatic secondary cases have been identified so far.\nThe two contacts are a 50-year-old (case # 2) and a 32-year-old (case # 3), living in Doha. Both were identified through contact tracing and are asymptomatic. Case #2 is the son of case #1 and has an underlying medical condition . Case #3 was involved in direct contact with case #1 and has no underlying medical conditions. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 29 November for both case #2 and case #3 and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on 29 November. As of 23 December, both are in a stable condition in an isolation ward where protocols for infection have been implemented.\nUpon identification of case #1, the case was isolated, the infection protocols were implemented as per WHO guidelines; investigation and contact tracing were initiated.\nAll 47 identified contacts of the patient have been monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for a period of 14 days following their last exposure to the patient.\nAll contacts were tested for MERS-CoV and test results were positive for two asymptomatic contacts (Case #2 and #3 mentioned above). WHO risk assessment\nInfection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.\nThe notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting or household contacts).\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO advice\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\nInfection measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.\nEarly identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\nMERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

The year saw millions worldwide protesting against governmental inaction on the cascading crises in the global environment. Anxiety over nuclear annihilation vied with concerns over the repugnant resurgence of ‘race science’ and the emergent ethics of gene editing. Amid the tumult, Nature asked seven scientists, scholars and historians to pluck a book from all time that speaks to our time.\nFreeman Dyson, Alondra Nelson, Emilie Savage-Smith, Ann Pettifor, Callum Roberts, Ismail Serageldin and Chikwe Ihekweazu chose science-inflected volumes — on the often-forgotten lessons of Hiroshima, the rise of unregulated markets, the ubiquity of plastic, mapping the eleventh-century world, and more. Together, they offer a composite lens on our complicated present. FREEMAN DYSON: Messages of Hiroshima\nHiroshima John Hersey (Alfred A. Knopf, 1946)\nJohn Hersey’s Hiroshima , published in 1946 — one year after the destruction of the city by a US atomic bomb — gave the world an enduring vision of nuclear war that has remained the dominant image in the minds of later generations. On the threshold of 2020, the 75th anniversary of the bombing, nuclear war is seen as crowds of half-naked and horribly burnt victims, fleeing from the flames of the burning city, lying down to die of wounds and thirst and radiation sickness. Hersey recorded that scene with unforgettable words in the first part of the book. But that is only half of the US journalist’s message.\nHiroshima also shows us an image of nuclear war as a tragedy with heroes as well as victims. Hersey’s heroes were doctor Terufumi Sasaki and Methodist pastor Kiyoshi Tanimoto. Sasaki worked with barely a break for three days and nights, using whatever bandages and medicaments he could find in the wreckage of his hospital, easing the pain and hoping to save the lives of an unending stream of sick and dying people pouring in from the surrounding ruins. Tanimoto ran through the burning city to Asano Park, where thousands of victims covered the ground. Soon, the flames advanced across the park. He found a boat on a nearby river and spent a day ferrying sick and dying people to safer ground. He stayed in the park for five days and nights, organizing teams of able-bodied people to bring food and cook meals for the wounded.\nThe two never knew how many lives they had saved. Each certainly saved several hundred.\nAfter the first days of horror and heroism, Hersey shows the destroyed city coming back to life, with fresh green grass and wild flowers quickly covering the ashes. For weeks, people who have been within a kilometre and a half of the explosion are dying of radiation sickness. After a month, those who are still alive slowly recover. After two months, the survivors are mostly back at work. The city is reborn as a community, with rich and poor sharing the hardships, and widows, widowers and orphans starting new lives.\nHiroshima ends with a quote from an essay written a year later by Toshio Nakamura for his teacher at school. Nakamura was ten years old when he lived through the disaster at Asano Park. “The neighbors were walking around burned and bleeding,” he wrote. “We went to the park. A whirlwind came. At night a gas tank burned and I saw the reflection in the river. We stayed in the park one night. Next day I went to Taiko Bridge and met my girl friends Kikushi and Murakami. They were looking for their mothers. But Kikushi’s mother was wounded and Murakami’s mother, alas, was dead.”\nThe second half of Hersey’s message is that we are a tough species, evolved to survive all kinds of calamities, including the calamity of nuclear war. Individuals die, but communities survive. Unfortunately, the public heard only the first half: the picture of doom. The response was to rush into a frenzy of bomb-building that made the dangers of nuclear war a hundred times worse.\nHad we heard the whole message, we would perhaps have chosen a wiser course: saying no to nuclear weapons as we have said no to biological weapons, building a saner world with manageable risks. ALONDRA NELSON: The return of eugenics\nBackdoor to Eugenics Troy Duster (Routledge, 1990)\nSome three decades ago, as global concern was tuned to the reunification of Germany, Nelson Mandela’s release from a South African prison and the launch of the Human Genome Project, sociologist Troy Duster published a quiet but prescient primer for the dawning age of DNA.\nBackdoor to Eugenics foretold a world in which the power of genetics extends well beyond its therapeutic potential. In this world, genetic explanations are offered for issues better explained by politics and social structure, such as inequality; the impact of genetic screening programmes depends on the resources of patients; and the state and businesses fund genetic testing, assembling large caches of personal data, with high stakes for the medical and criminal-justice systems.\nThese developments did materialize, laying the cornerstone for the social science of genetics. The book also anticipated some of the thorny ethical and political questions we face in today’s post-genomic era. For instance, how did screening of newborn babies for medical conditions — once seen as radical, now ubiquitous become legitimized? Do we own our own DNA data — and should they be readily available to clinical researchers and the police without oversight?\nIn the new genetics, Duster argues, human life is seen through a narrow lens (a phenomenon he calls the “prism of heritability”). He uses the metaphor of front and back doors to illuminate cases in which that lens is used, respectively, in overt or covert ways. And he shows how genetics slides into eugenics.\nFor Duster, eugenics through the “front door” was exemplified by Nazi Germany’s mobilization of science, technology, propaganda and statecraft to demonize people with traits deemed ‘unfit’. That culminated in the genocide of Jewish people, people with disabilities and others. There were echoes of this in the United States, with exclusionary immigration policies and the forced sterilization of people including those considered ‘feeble-minded’.\nLessons were learnt in the wake of this reprehensible history, and by 1990 it seemed as if scientific racism was highly unlikely to repeat itself. Duster noted that the front door to eugenics was effectively closed. However, the back door was at risk of being opened: emergent thought and practice formed a slim ‘wedge’. This insidiously associated genetics with ‘target’ or ‘at-risk’ populations that mapped onto vulnerable and marginalized communities.\nOnce this wedge was inserted, Duster argued, a whole infrastructure of surveillance could be set in place. It might begin with turning some voluntary genetic testing into social requirements. (The mandatory sampling and analysing of DNA from certain criminal suspects in many US jurisdictions is a case in point, as is genomic surveillance in China.) It might involve increasing what was tested, from acute medical conditions to social phenomena such as ‘educational attainment’. With new norms in place, data collection and scrutiny could be expanded.\nDuster’s “backdoor” genetic analyses share qualities with today’s direct-to-consumer DNA testing. Both are voluntary, tout the value of individual and community participation, and seem to be benign agents of self-knowledge and health information. But the issue of data misuse and surveillance is now unavoidable.\nThe increasingly crucial message of Backdoor to Eugenics is that genetic disorders and social orders are inextricably linked. Duster made a provocative argument about the way in which intertwined political, cultural and technical forces were giving rise to broad and potentially dangerous uses of genetics. He cautioned, for instance, that the seemingly benign medical surveillance of newborn screening risked diverting attention from challenges that confront black and low-income mothers in the United States, such as access to high-quality prenatal care.\nDuster’s concerns have been borne out in many ways — for instance, the growing acceptance of genetic scrutiny of embryos through processes such as fetal DNA screening for Down’s syndrome. More dramatically, an untested gene-editing procedure was used last year to make heritable changes to the world’s first ‘CRISPR babies’.\nThen, as now, key questions remain. What kind of genomics should we have, and for whom? What assumptions are being made about patient populations, ported into genetics analysis and reified as research findings? In this moment, the back door seems more gaping than ajar. Illustration by Richard Wilkinson EMILIE SAVAGE-SMITH: Mapping uncertainties\nThe Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eye Anon (1020–1050)\nDespite vast advances in many fields of science, we live with uncertainties, from the progress of climate change to the nature of consciousness. As we try today to understand and explain the world, a book written 1,000 years ago can still speak to us — not least in its concern with predicting everything from flooding to war. In The Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eye , a well-educated Egyptian tried to draw together everything he could learn about the structure of the heavens and Earth.\nHis precise identity is unknown, but he had a love of maps and diagrams. In these, beginning with the fixed stars and Saturn — the outermost planet visible to the naked eye — he worked his way down to Earth’s surface, with its vast oceans surrounding landmasses occupied by peoples of varying appearances and customs.\nCompiled between 1020 and 1050, The Book of Curiosities exemplifies the intense intellectual voraciousness of scholars in Egypt during the era. Cairo was then the centre of a global maritime power, with tentacles stretching from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus Valley and down the East African coast. The city boasted some of the best-known figures in the history of Islamic science, including the highly original observational astronomer Ibn Yunus, and Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), renowned today for his work on optics. The book is preserved in a richly illustrated Arabic manuscript acquired in 2002 to mark the 400th birthday of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, UK. Over the subsequent decade, it was fully translated and analysed.\nWith neither telescopes nor microscopes to help them, scholars of the early medieval Arabic-speaking world tried to make sense of the Universe and the constantly changing seas and lands around them. As they knew from the scientific writings of the day, Earth was without question spherical. Various attempts were made to calculate its circumference. The ninth-century caliph al-Mamun sent astronomers into the desert of what would become Iraq to determine the length of a meridian arc of one degree. The eleventh-century Persian scholar al-Biruni applied trigonometry to the problem — as well as tackling the relative size of the five planets visible to the naked eye.\nAll events in the skies were thought to affect those on Earth; the microcosm mirrors the macrocosm, it was believed. So celestial mapping became something of an industry, not only for timekeeping but for the prediction of earthly events. The ability to forecast winds, earthquakes, storms, droughts, famines and wars was of great importance in that vulnerable era. Some concerns of our medieval Egyptian author are strikingly similar to ours. When discussing the futility of trying to portray on a map any coastline in precise detail, he says: “Sometimes the lower parts of a region are inundated, and we have witnessed in our short lifetime wastelands and passable lands overcome by sea.”\nMost of his correlations and explanations have been long rejected. In reading The Book of Curiosities , however, you cannot but have respect for the observational skills on show, as well as for his logical reasoning. For instance, he argued that the Nile floods were the result of snow melting on equatorial mountains. The work is a much-needed reminder that we are not the only intelligent people to have inhabited this planet. And it makes you wonder: what will generations 1,000 years hence think of our scientific theories and explanations? Illustration by Richard Wilkinson ANN PETTIFOR: The market for dystopia\nThe Great Transformation Karl Polanyi (Farrar & Rinehart, 1944)\nWe live in turbulent and uncertain times. Political insurgencies have erupted from Santiago to Hong Kong. Citizens have risen up in anger against ruling elites. Institutions trusted for upholding democracy, the law and public discourse are undermined daily by political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. More and more public space and wealth are being privatized. Everywhere there is fear: of financial and economic collapse, of a loss of national identity and sovereignty, of political upheaval, of trade wars and real wars. And there is a growing fear that our ecological life-support systems are poised to collapse. These fears, along with the marketization of society, fuel the rise of protectionism, nationalism and even authoritarianism.\nAre we witnessing the dissolution of economic globalization, the international system on which Western prosperity and political stability has depended for more than 40 years?\nFor an understanding of the forces at play, there is no text more illuminating than Karl Polanyi’s 1944 classic, The Great Transformation . In this, his most famous book, Polanyi sought to explain the economic, social and political forces that led to the twentieth century’s catastrophic world wars and the march of fascism.\nPolanyi — an Austro-Hungarian economic historian and social philosopher — noted that nineteenth-century society rested on two pillars: liberal capitalism and representative democracy. Liberal capitalism, in turn, rested on the gold standard, a system of governance that embraced world markets in capital, currencies and commodities. Thus, both domestic and international markets were effectively governed by private, not public, authority. Governments were gradually stripped of autonomy in key economic policy decisions. This internationalized market system demanded that society be subordinated to its needs, argued Polanyi in his lectures (see go.nature.com/2pajnpd ). Markets then became detached from political systems of regulatory democracy, which were necessarily bound by borders.\nFor Polanyi, that separation was the system’s deep flaw and “the clue to its rapid downfall” in 1933. The idea of self-adjusting international markets, detached from societal regulation and oversight, implied a bleak utopia indeed. Such an institution could not exist, he argued in The Great Transformation , without annihilating the human and natural substance of society. The gradual changes leading up to its dissolution in 1933, as part of US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s response to the Great Depression — were in progress long before the start of the First World War, Polanyi explains. But they remained unnoticed at the time. In a reflection apt for our times, he notes that “a society does not become conscious of the true nature of the institutions under which it lived until those institutions have already passed”.\nToday, Big Oil, Big Tech and Big Banks effectively police themselves. They have moved “from offering utopia to selling dystopia”, as economic analyst Rana Foroohar argues (see go.nature.com/3822vkb ).\nThe effective organization of the world today is economic, not political. As Polanyi predicted, citizens are belatedly discovering that their politicians and political institutions are impotent against these forces. His book is truly one for our times. CALLUM ROBERTS: Dawn of the plastic world\nPlastics V. E. Yarsley and E. G. Couzens (Pelican Books, 1941)\nBooks that predict the future, particularly one 70 years distant, are usually memorable for how far-fetched or quaint their prophecies seem today, not for their veracity. Plastics , a slender volume published in 1941 by two British chemists, Victor Yarsley and Edward Couzens, is exceptional in a different way. It is both uncannily prescient and marred by an enormous blind spot.\nYarsley and Couzens were at the forefront of the plastics revolution, making rapid advances in the field of polymer chemistry and the manufacture of original products from these near-miraculous new materials. Plastics, they wrote, cannot corrode and are sturdy, lightweight and “of a clarity exceeding that of glass if required”. Good insulators, the materials are pleasant to the touch and exceptionally resistant to acids and oils. “The manufacturer of the future will say, not ‘of what material shall I make this article?’ but what kind of plastic shall I use?” they declare.\nTaking this as their lodestone, Yarsley and Couzens describe the future for ‘Plastic Man’. For children, it will be a world “of colour and bright shining surfaces”, almost unbreakable, safely rounded and easily cleaned. In this polymer utopia, the growing child “cleans his teeth and brushes his hair with plastic brushes with plastic bristles”, wears “synthetic silk and wool fastened with plastic zip fasteners” and sits on moulded plastic furniture. In old age, plastic dentures and plastic-lensed spectacles beckon. The material will, in short, be ubiquitous.\nYarsley and Couzens conclude their homage by writing that when the smoke and mess of the Second World War have dissipated and the world begins to rebuild, the return of a newly powerful, industry-driven science will lead to ”a new, brighter, cleaner and more beautiful world”. That line jars today. In fulfilling their utilitarian promise, plastics have become a blight of modern life, invading soils, waterways, seas and even the atmosphere. Some 150 million tonnes of plastic circulate in our oceans now, and in the United States alone, more than 26 million tonnes reached landfill in 2017.\nOne of the great lessons of history is that scientists, in running away with their enthusiasms, perceive the consequences of their inventions only selectively. There is not a word in the book on plastic waste. Perhaps the writers thought plastics would last forever. Nor is there a single sentence on recycling; that is odd, in the Second World War world of ‘make do and mend’, cooking from scraps and saving cardboard. The idea of recycling was gaining traction in the oil industry of the time, but perhaps it didn’t fit with the authors’ vision of a shiny new consumer paradise. Ultimately, if Yarsley and Couzens had had the vision, their prophecy of a plastic world might have extended to the tide of plastic waste now choking the planet.\nThe biographical sketch of Couzens provides one of the best lines of the book: “Though he is a firm believer in the future of plastics, he himself prefers glass and metals.” ISMAIL SERAGELDIN: A mind for radical equality\nSketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (1795)\nWe are challenged today by the results of our past actions and current lifestyles. They are complex and tangled: climate change, biodiversity loss, water shortages and regions beset by both swift population growth and potential famine. We are in a battle to live sustainably.\nSome might say that this is a moment for English cleric Thomas Malthus’s 1798 An Essay on the Principle of Population . Yet that book assumes that humans are no different from animals, and respond to resource availability in the same way. I look to a very different work by a contemporary of Malthus’s: the remarkably optimistic Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind . Its author, the mathematician and philosopher Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, saw no limits to the capacity of human intelligence, and called on his readers to use it to build a better society.\nCondorcet wrote the Sketch while hiding from the extremist wing of the French Revolution. In March 1794, its forces captured him, and possibly murdered him. The essay was published posthumously.\nCondorcet had a brilliant and far-ranging mind; his early work included the pioneering Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions , in 1785. His world view was a vision of what could — and should — be, if we aspire to a world of reason and respect for our common humanity. His views are striking even for the late eighteenth century, when sociopolitical radicalism abounded. Condorcet advocated the abolition of slavery and equal rights for women, including women’s suffrage. He wanted economic freedom, religious tolerance, legal and educational reform. In the 1790 essay On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship , he argued for human rights generated by virtue of our shared intellectual and ethical capacities:\nThe rights of men stem exclusively from the fact that they are sentient beings, capable of acquiring moral ideas and of reasoning upon them. Since women have the same qualities, they necessarily also have the same rights. Either no member of the human race has any true rights, or else they all have the same ones; and anyone who votes against the rights of another, whatever his religion, colour or sex, automatically forfeits his own.\nCondorcet wanted a classless French republic of citizens protecting their freedom through voting. He designed voting systems, including one based on comparative ranking to satisfy majority rule (a method favoured by Nobel-prizewinning economists Amartya Sen and Eric Maskin).At the global scale, Condorcet called for equality among nations. That included improving people’s physical health and longevity, education and moral development. But he recognized that the equality he was describing, both for nations and for individuals, is not absolute: it is equality of freedom and of rights.\nThis remarkable thinker believed that human ingenuity can overcome all obstacles, and that human goodness can steer us away from tyranny and greed. In this time of global challenge and national turbulence, his wise, inspiring ideas deserve to be remembered. Illustration by Richard Wilkinson CHIKWE IHEKWEAZU: Localizing public health\nNo Time to Lose: A Life In Pursuit Of Deadly Viruses Peter Piot (W. W. Norton, 2012).\nPeter Piot’s No Time To Lose is a passionate account of his leading roles in the discovery of Ebola, the most consequential emerging disease of this decade, and in the global response to HIV and AIDS. I find it speaks profoundly to the current situation in Africa.\nAs a public-health epidemiologist, I have grown up professionally in the era of AIDS. I have visited Yambuku in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, site of the Ebola virus’s first appearance, while supporting the response to a 2004 Ebola outbreak in what is now South Sudan. Thus, No Time To Lose felt very immediate to me. Piot draws you in as he describes the appearance of the then-unknown and unnamed Ebola virus in a sample delivered to his laboratory in Belgium in 1976; his first fact-finding trip to Africa; and his professional stint in Yambuku, treating infected people in a hospital run by Catholic nurses. Piot’s account of the conversation that led to the naming of Ebola seems almost too simple to be true; despite the virus’s severity, there was no naming convention at the time.\nIn the 1980s, he worked with other scientists investigating many infectious diseases, including HIV infection. As his career pivots to global health politics, he describes in lucid detail his role in the establishment of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and his leadership of the agency between 1994 and 2008. From laboratories to field epidemiology, boardrooms and political chambers, the book charts an incredibly impactful career in science and the fine arts of diplomacy, communication and political engagement in difficult situations.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is now grappling with the second-largest recorded outbreak of Ebola, which began in 2018. Despite new tools, more than 3,000 people have been infected and over 2,000 have died in the past year.\nNew viruses, such as MERS coronavirus, continue to emerge; old ones persist. At the same time, the population of Africa grows and socio-economic progress has plateaued. As I reflect on the gripping descriptions in No Time to Lose , I try to make sense of the paradox of what is happening on the continent.\nOne of the biggest lessons from Piot’s book is that we must focus on building strong, resilient local institutions with a sustainable capacity for infectious-disease prevention, detection and response. Although it was exhilarating to read his account, I caught myself wishing for a different ending: the emergence of a great research institution in Africa. This could train the virologists, epidemiologists and public-health leaders of the future, on the continent where they are most likely to emerge.\nA lot of progress has been made since Piot first travelled to Yambuku, more than 40 years ago. As we continue to experience large outbreaks affecting lives and economies in Africa, we must persist in blazing the path towards building local capacity. For that, there really is no time to lose.\nNature 576 , 374-378 (2019)", "external_links": ["https://www.scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_sauthors=%22Freeman%2BDyson%22", "https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_sauthors=%22Freeman%2BDyson%22", "https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_sauthors=%22Alondra%2BNelson%22", "https://www.scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&btnG=Search+Scholar&as_sauthors=%22Alondra%2BNelson%22", "https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar"], "published": "2019-12-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-13T14:32:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

If the answer is “never,” you’re in the majority. Every winter, you wear them daily, touching germy surfaces like door handles and—let’s be honest—using them as a tissue for your runny nose. As expected, that makes them nothing short of a hot bed for bacteria.\nIn a 2015 study conducted by Good Morning America , gloves of all different materials were swabbed for bacteria and viruses. While some samples tested positive for coronavirus, which is commonly behind winter colds and infections, there were also more serious discoveries. Nine came back with potentially harmful bacteria, including staph and MRSA. And, keep in mind, this was with a very small sample size.\nNever washing your gloves isn’t the best idea for your health. (It also makes them smell.) The good news is it’s incredibly easy to clean them, and these are the best tactics to use this season. How to wash your gloves, according to the material 1. Cotton\nCotton gloves might not be the warmest option, but they’re certainly the easiest to clean. Put them in the washing machine just like you would your other clothes. Either wash them separately, or toss them in with lights or darks, depending on the color. Then lay them out flat to dry, as they will shrink in the dryer (unless you’re not using heat). 2. Wool\nWool is more delicate, so you have to be gentle. Instead of using the washing machine, soak them in the sink or a bowl in warm water with a gentle laundry detergent. After five minutes, gently rinse them with cool water. Instead of wringing them out, which can affect the shape, gently squeeze out the water then lay them flat to air dry. 3. Leather and faux leather\nTo clean leather and faux leather gloves, wet a clean cloth or paper towel and use a tiny amount of a mild soap to gently clean the surface of the gloves. Rinse them with lukewarm water. After they dry, turn them inside out and disinfect the inside by spraying an equal amount of vinegar and water , then lay them flat to air dry. 4. Nylon\nLike wool gloves, it’s best to wash nylon gloves by soaking them in warm water with a gentle detergent for five minutes. Then rinse them with warm water and lay them out flat to air dry. 5. Polyester\nTo clean polyester gloves (like many running gloves!), wash them in warm water with a gentle detergent in the washing machine, unless the care instructions on the tag says otherwise. If you’re unsure, soak them instead. Avoid the dryer and lay them out flat to air dry.", "external_links": ["https://abcnews.go.com/US/avoid-germs-winter-gloves/story?id=29242416", "https://abcnews.go.com/US/avoid-germs-winter-gloves/story", "https://www.abcnews.go.com/US/avoid-germs-winter-gloves/story?id=29242416"], "published": "2019-12-15T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-15T19:36:04.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The WHO has prepared a list of top 5 diseases that could create a pandemic in future. The list includes diseases for whom medication is not yet available. Ebola and Marburg\nThe virus, Marburg was first discovered in the year 1967 and the Ebola in 1976. These viruses can be easily transferred to both humans and primates. Further, it can spread among humans through the direct contact of bodily fluids and blood. Both of the viruses show symptoms of diarrhoea, fever, bleeding and vomiting. Although vaccines are under evaluation, there’s not an approved treatment yet. MERS\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS, was first discovered in the year 2012, in Saudi Arabia. This contagious virus can be transferred due to close exposure to respiratory secretions, like coughing. The virus could be found affecting mainly elderly people with a mortality rate of 40 per cent. Most of the Arabian Peninsula countries are affected by this virus. Recently, cases from South Korea are coming into light. Lassa Fever\nFor the first time, the virus of Lassa Fever was discovered in 1950 and the multimammate rate is its reservoir. It has spread through the consumption of food which has been contaminated with rat urine or inhalation of vaporizers. In 20% of the cases, people were affected either due to exposure to bodily fluids or blood. Around 80% of patients didn’t notice any symptoms, only one out of 5 infections were severe. About 15-20 per cent of patients died due to Lassa Fever. Though an antiviral medication is said to be effective, there’s still no vaccine available. West Africa is a region where this disease is pandemic. Nipah\nNipah was first identified in the year 1999, among the pig farmers in Singapore and Malaysia. Since then, regular reports of outbreaks came from Bangladesh. Not only humans but also pigs were infected by this virus. But it became severe in the case of human resulting in the death of 40% of all the infected people. Direct exposure or contact to bats, pigs or date palm contaminated by a virus carrying bats are the media of transmission. There is no treatment or vaccine for humans, which is why it’s considered to be one of the deadliest viruses of the world. SARS\nLike MERS, SARS or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is the result of a coronavirus. There’s no certainty about the natural reservoir, however, there is a probability that it could be civets and bats. For the very first time, it was noticed in Asia in 2003. From Asia, it quickly spread to as many as 12 countries including Europe, America, and Asia, reporting 8,000 cases and 8,000 death cases. Mainly, it affected healthy and young people outside of hospital settings. It’s good news that since 2004, not a single case of SARS has been registered. Besides, who knows what might happen in future. If it comes back into existence, no medication has been developed which can stop the virus. 2019-12-21", "external_links": [], "published": "2019-12-21T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2019-12-21T12:02:39.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Virologist Leo Poon, DPhil, a SARS expert from Hong Kong University, told Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), a public broadcasting service in Hong Kong, that it's too early to say the outbreak is a SARS event. He added that the emergence of atypical pneumonia cases requires identifying the responsible pathogen and ruling out SARS or other types of coronaviruses.

Dec 30 CMRE update\nNew fatal MERS case recorded in Saudi Arabia\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) of Saudi Arabia reported a new MERS-CoV case from earlier this month.\nThe case-patient was a 70-year-old man from the city of Hafar Al Batin in the northeastern part of the country. The man died from complications of his Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. The MOH also said the man had camel contact, a common risk factor for MERS.\nThis is the fourth MERS case recorded in Saudi Arabia in December. In November the MOH noted 12 cases.\nThe WHO said in an update earlier this month that, since MERS-CoV was first detected in humans in 2012, it has received reports of 2,484 cases, at least 857 of them fatal.

An efficient vaccine for the prophylaxis of humans in hotspots of the infection (e.g., Saudi Arabia) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved. In this study, a chimeric DNA construct was designed to encode an influenza A/H1N1 NA protein which is flanking immunogenic amino acids (aa) 736–761 of MERS-CoV spike protein. Using the generated chimeric construct, a novel recombinant vaccine strain against pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) and MERS-CoV was generated (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3). The chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccine strain comprises a recombinant PR8-based vaccine, expressing the PB1, HA, and chimeric NA of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the PR8-based 5 + 3 H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain that lacks the MERS-CoV spike peptide insert. In BALB/c mice, the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and H1N1pdm09. This novel approach succeeded in developing a recombinant influenza virus with potential use as a bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV. This approach provides a basis for the future development of chimeric influenza-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and other viruses.

Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS pages of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP's Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the World Health Organization's latest news for more information and health advice.

Another 121 people are under medical supervision as doctors try to confirm whether or not they have the same illness.\nThe sickness, which is being compared to bird flu and SARS, appears to have originated in or near the Huanan seafood market, and some of the original infections were traced to workers who operate stalls there. Now, health workers and government officials say that two female patients from Hong Kong are also exhibiting symptoms, and that the pair had visited Wuhan just two weeks prior.\nAs the South China Morning Post reports, health officials still don’t know exactly where this viral pneumonia came from, though they have ruled out multiple possibilities. Despite the fact that additional infections have been confirmed, it’s still believed that the virus doesn’t pass from person to person, as no medical staff or relatives of those who are infected have been diagnosed with the same illness.\nIt’s still possible that the illness is related to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, according to Dr. Gauden Galea of the World Health Organization. “There are many potential causes of this type of illness and further laboratory tests are ongoing to determine the cause of the disease,” Galea said in a statement. “At this point, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak.”\nIt’s important to note that no deaths have been attributed to this new, unknown pneumonia virus and that Chinese officials seem to be doing their best to isolate anyone who might be infected in order to separate them from the general population. Hopefully, this will be enough to put a lid on an increasingly scary situation.\nSign up for BGR's Newsletter .

Eleven of the 44 were seriously ill, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said, though there were no reported deaths to date. The health of 121 close contacts of the cases was being monitored. The infections are linked to a large seafood market where it is believed some exotic animals were also sold for consumption.\nRelated: Pneumonia cases linked to vaping are still rising. And federal officials don’t know what’s causing them The World Health Organization has said little about the outbreak beyond that it is in close contact with China authorities on the issue.\n“We’re closely monitoring the situation in Wuhan and are in active communication with our counterparts in China,” WHO’s regional office for the Western Pacific Region, which includes China, said on Twitter. “We’ve activated our incident management system across the three levels of\nWHO (country office, regional office, HQ) and can launch a broader response, if needed.”\n#China has reported to WHO regarding a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province.The Govt has also met with our country office,and updated @WHO on the situation. Govt actions to control the incident have been instituted and investigations into the cause are ongoing. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/ScUV6j1crD\n— World Health Organization Western Pacific (@WHOWPRO) January 4, 2020\nThe agency noted that China “has extensive capacity to respond to public health events and is responding proactively and rapidly to the current incident in Wuhan – isolating patients, tracing close contacts, cleaning up the market, and searching for the cause and for additional cases.”\nRalph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina, agreed that China has deep expertise in virology. Baric has a collaborative grant with some researchers in Wuhan to study emerging coronaviruses, and has visited the facilities there.\n“Wuhan is the epicenter for a lot of virology research in China. They have state of the art BSL3 and BSL4 facilities and world-class facilities to do anything that you would want to do on new emerging infectious diseases. So it’s occurring in the right spot,” he said.\nBSL is shorthand for the bio-safety level designation of a laboratory; Level 3 and Level 4 are the labs in which the most dangerous pathogens are worked on.\nRelated: Doctors Without Borders criticizes the Gavi coalition over access to pneumonia vaccines Social media platforms — both in China and outside it — have been abuzz with discussion of the Wuhan outbreak, with some commentators arguing the lack of a clear answer by now is reminiscent of China’s behavior during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.\nBut Baric disagreed, saying China’s approach to infectious disease outbreaks has evolved considerably since SARS, an event for which it was harshly criticized globally.\n“The situation in China between 2003 and 2020 is night and day,” he said. “They have many of the best virologists in the world there that are working on this. And my gut feeling is we’re going to see a showcase of what they’ve accomplished in 20 years.”\nKoopmans and Baric have a number of questions they’d like answered — “very soon,” Koopmans said — to help assess the severity of the situation.\nKnowing whether Chinese scientists have identified the cause of the illness is top of the list. Whether it is indeed a new virus — and what viral family it belongs to — is right up there too.\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine.\nPlease enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human: During the SARS outbreak, it took a full month from when the WHO tasked a global network of 11 laboratories to find the cause of the outbreak before confirmation was received that a new coronavirus was the cause. The SARS coronavirus probably originated in bats, but civet cats — wild animals eaten as a delicacy in southern China — were the virus’ route to people.\nTechnology has improved a lot since then, said Baric, who said multiplexing PCR — polymerase chain reaction testing — and RNA-Seq, which looks for evidence of the RNA of pathogens in clinical samples, could make finding the culprit a much quicker job this time round.\nBut even with the new technology, finding the cause of pneumonia can be tricky. With some infections, by the time a person is evidently ill, their immune system has cleared away most of the causative agent. The symptoms of illness are actually the effect the cascade of immune system weapons unleashed on tissues that had been infected.\n“There’s a window there of viral detection of the viral nucleic acid,” Baric said.\n“If most of these initial patients were caught late in infection, when the more severe disease symptoms came on, they may not have any acute cases and it may be very difficult. Very low levels of nucleic acid to chase to discover the disease.”\nKoopmans noted finding the cause may be complicated by the fact that pneumonia is common and can be caused by many pathogens. If authorities started looking for pneumonia cases after realizing there was a problem in Wuhan, some of the cases they found might have been unrelated to the actual event.\nRelated: Two down, one to go: After decades-long campaign, type 3 polioviruses are set to be eradicated Both are keen to know if there is any spread of the illness between people, which would be worrying. Wuhan health authorities have said there was no human-to-human transmission. But unless they know what is causing the illness, how long the illness takes to develop, and have developed a test that can detect mild cases, it is not clear that can be ruled out at this point.\n“I don’t find the comments [about human transmission] that I see spread throughout the internet as credible — unless they know what it is,” Baric said.\nThe fact that health officials in Wuhan closed and decontaminated the seafood market — there is video of this happening on social media — is suggestive that an animal virus had spilled over into people, he added.\nThe statement from the Wuhan health board said that influenza, avian influenza and adenovirus infections — the latter can cause serious respiratory illness — have been ruled out.\nBecause of SARS, attention is focusing on coronaviruses, though both Koopmans and Baric noted a number of different virus families could cause respiratory outbreaks.\nBut coronaviruses have shown themselves to be adept at jumping from animal hosts to people, sometimes establishing themselves as human pathogens. There are four human coronaviruses that are common causes of cold-like illness. Those viruses were formerly animal viruses — experts can tell by comparing their genetic sequences to animal coronaviruses. When the four started infecting humans is not clear in most cases.\nSome coronaviruses have jumped from animals to people on multiple occasions — the MERS virus in the Arabian Peninsula is an example — but haven’t acquired the ability to spread easily from person to person.\nRelated: The fireman of global health: The WHO’s emergencies chief is put to the test Sometimes the damage can be significant.\nIn late November of 2002, people in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong started to become ill from unexplained pneumonias. The WHO began hearing rumors of the illness, but Chinese authorities played it down.\nBut in late February, travelers from a number of countries — Vietnam, Singapore, Canada among them — stayed on the same floor in a Hong Kong hotel as a doctor from China who had been looking after some of the pneumonia cases. He was ill, and he infected multiple other hotel guests, seeding the new infection across Southeast Asia and to Toronto.\nTransmission of the new disease was stopped by the summer of 2003, but in its short history SARS — short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome — infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800.\nBaric said he’s hopeful Chinese scientists will have figured out what is going on in Wuhan and will report on it soon.\n“If the number of cases keeps increasing, then it becomes more and more of a global public health threat,” he said. “The chance of [infected] people slipping through the screening platforms for international travel or travel elsewhere in China become greater as long as they don’t know what the pathogen is.”", "external_links": ["https://t.co/ScUV6j1crD", "https://who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/", "https://www.platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china/", "https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html", "https://doximity.com/inbox/conversations/new_message?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statnews.com%2F2020%2F01%2F04%2Fmystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china%2F&#038;subject=Experts%20search%20for%20answers%20in%20limited%20information%20about%20mystery%20pneumonia%20outbreak%20in%20China", "https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/", "https://www.doximity.com/inbox/conversations/new_message", "https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/", "https://twitter.com/WHOWPRO/status/1213331054313885702", "https://www.twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china/&#038;via=statnews&#038;text=Experts+search+for+answers+in+limited+information+about+mystery+pneumonia+outbreak+in+China", "https://www.t.co/ScUV6j1crD", "https://www.twitter.com/WHO", "https://twitter.com/WHOWPRO/status/1213331054313885702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china/&#038;mini=true&#038;source=STAT", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/China", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china/&#038;via=statnews&#038;text=Experts+search+for+answers+in+limited+information+about+mystery+pneumonia+outbreak+in+China", "https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china/", "https://www.twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.twitter.com/WHOWPRO/status/1213331054313885702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.twitter.com/HelenBranswell", "https://linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china/&#038;mini=true&#038;source=STAT", "https://www.doximity.com/inbox/conversations/new_message?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statnews.com%2F2020%2F01%2F04%2Fmystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china%2F&#038;subject=Experts%20search%20for%20answers%20in%20limited%20information%20about%20mystery%20pneumonia%20outbreak%20in%20China", "http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010309017", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010309017", "https://twitter.com/WHO", "https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/04/mystery-pneumonia-outbreak-china", "https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en"], "published": "2020-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-04T19:58:21.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

It is causing a lot of concern among mothers in my practice and community as they are posting “my son has coronavirus”. Of course that leads to a Google search and the next thing you know I have parents calling concerned about SARS! (a rare complication). Coronavirus (which is named for the crown like shape of the viral particles under a microscope) is just another fall and winter virus that typically causes cold like symptoms with a scratchy throat, congestion, runny nose and cough. It may also cause several days of fever. Coronavirus “acts” like many of the other viruses that we are seeing now, including rhinovirus and parainfluenza. While most everyone gets a coronavirus infection in their lifetime, knowing the name of the virus really doesn’t change anything about the treatment. Having your child’s nose or throat swabbed and sent for a fairly expensive test so that “you may have peace of mind” does not dictate any different treatment than that of any other respiratory virus. Symptomatic relief has been the advice for treating all of these upper respiratory infections….long before we could test for them in an office setting. How do you treat it? Treat the fever if there is one and do not send your child to daycare or school until they have been fever free for 24 hours (you also need to stay home if you have a fever). Use over the counter saline nose drops to help suction your child’s nose or to help thin the mucous so that they can “blow” more effectively. Take a steamy shower to relieve the congestion and loosen the cough. Use a cool mist humidifier in your child’s room (especially if you have the heat running). Make sure to teach your children how to “cough into their elbow” rather than their hands. I am continuing to hold a lot of hands as parents worry about all of these different respiratory viruses….but naming them is not going to change treatment in the otherwise healthy child. Making sure your child washes their hands and try to teach your older children to keep their hands away from their eyes, nose and mouth will serve you better than worrying about which virus they may have been exposed to.

The outbreak began in China, where 349 people died from the disease on the mainland and 299 more perished in Hong Kong, according to Asian news channel CNA . The SARS virus spreads through person-to-person contact and can be expelled from an infected individual when they cough or sneeze, contaminating both people and nearby objects. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that China was free of SARS in 2004, but now, a mysterious bout of viral illness has led to speculation that the disease is back.\nForty-four cases of the unidentified illness have been reported so far, including 11 \"severe\" cases, according to the international news agency AFP . Many of the infected individuals were stall holders at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which health authorities have closed until further notice, according to the South China Morning Post . In a further effort to contain the outbreak, airports in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan have ramped up screenings for fever among their passengers.\nRelated: The 9 Deadliest Viruses on Earth\nThe cause of the infections remains unknown, but the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has ruled out \"influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases\" as potential culprits, according to TK. \"At this point, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak,\" said Gauden Galea, WHO's representative in China, AFP reported.\nIn response to speculation about a SARS outbreak, the Wudan police announced Wednesday (Jan. 1) that eight individuals had been punished for \"publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification,\" the AFP added.\n\"If it were SARS, we are experienced in managing it,\" Emily Chan Ying-yang, a medical professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a visiting professor at the University of Oxford, told the South China Morning Post. \"But if it is a new strain, then we should pay attention.\"\nDuring the 2002 outbreak, SARS caused many fatalities among young people, so it's important to determine whether serious cases of the virus are occurring in young or elderly individuals, she added.\nThe mystery pneumonia may also be caused by a rare virus or one that was previously unknown, Dr. Jiang Rongmeng of Beijing Ditan Hospital told the South China Morning Post.\nUnlike in the 2002 SARS outbreak, \"no apparent human-to-human transmission has been detected so far.

All patients are being treated in quarantine and no deaths have been reported. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), symptoms of the pneumonia are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs. The outbreak came to light in late December and prompted fears in China of a possible resurgence of SARS, an acute viral respiratory illness first reported in the country in 2002 that caused a pandemic that ripped through Asia. SARS spread to 37 countries worldwide , infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 from November, 2002 to July, 2003. The illness is brought on by a coronavirus, and symptoms include fever, cough, severe headache, dizziness and other flu-like complaints. Read More Amid growing disquiet, Wuhan authorities said on Sunday they had excluded the possibility of SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and bird flu. A doctor injects a flu vaccination. If not SARS, then what is it? According to the Wuhan health commission, the infection broke out between December 12 and December 29, with some of the patients employed at a seafood market in the city. Local media reported that the market -- which has been closed since January 1 for disinfection -- also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes, sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it is highly likely that the outbreak was caused by a \"brand-new viral pneumonia.\" \"The concern now is whether the game (sold at the market) is one of the reasons for the outbreak,\" he told CNN. According to Hui, many new pathogens have been transmitted to humans from animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic first broke out. And dromedary camels are considered a likely source of MERS, he said. Authorities have said that there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission so far, and no healthcare workers have been infected. At least 163 people who have had close contact with those infected have been placed under medical observation. But there are still fears of a nationwide epidemic. The outbreak came just before the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel season, when hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to be crammed into trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Millions of Chinese are also expected to travel overseas around Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25. Professor Leo Poon, a virologist at Hong Kong University and a SARS expert, said the severity of the situation to come depends on whether the pneumonia in Wuhan can be transmitted among humans. \"If it only transmits from animals to humans, now that the market has been shut down and sanitized, the chances for people to be infected will be low,\" he said. Hui, from Chinese University, said the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out. \"Most often, respiratory viruses can be transmitted among humans. It is only a matter of how contagious it is,\" he said. Passengers get their temperature checked in 2015 as part of preventive measures against the spread of MERS at Hong Kong airport. Asia steps up screening The current outbreak in Wuhan has put Asian governments on close watch, stepping up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and notification requirements. In Hong Kong, 21 people have been found with fever or respiratory symptoms after returning from Wuhan, according to the city's Hospital Authority. Seven of them have been discharged, and so far none of them has been linked to the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan. Travelers arriving from Wuhan are also being screened at Hong Kong airport. In Singapore, travelers arriving from the Chinese city are also required to go through temperature screening, according to the Ministry of Health. Doctors have been alerted to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who recently returned from there. In South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a quarantine task force and warned visitors to Wuhan not to touch wild animals or poultry, or visit local markets. Taiwan on Sunday stepped up measures by expanding the conditions for notification of suspected cases of Wuhan pneumonia, according to government-run news agency CNA. The World Health Organization said in a statement Sunday that \"there is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology.\" It said it does not recommend any specific measures for travelers, and \"advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the current information available on this event.\" Fall and winter months are traditionally prone to flu epidemics. In the United States, the current flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. He said while it is impossible to predict how the flu will play out, the season so far is on track to be as severe as the 2017-18 flu season, which was the deadliest in more than four decades, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "external_links": ["https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202001050011", "http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010509020", "https://moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/precautionary-measures-in-response-to-severe-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china", "https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en", "http://www.wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010509020", "https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457455", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457455", "https://who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/", "https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/precautionary-measures-in-response-to-severe-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china", "https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/", "https://www.focustaiwan.tw/society/202001050011"], "published": "2020-01-06T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-06T14:35:57.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The female patient, 20, was eventually cleared by authorities and found to be infected with known viruses instead of the one in question. Tighter security and access controls were also in place at the Sha Tin site for its first full day in operation since the occupation by radical anti-government protesters in November, which devastated swathes of the campus and halted classes. Many were seen on the grounds wearing surgical or particulate filter masks after Wuhan authorities put the number of people admitted to hospital with an unidentified type of pneumonia to 59 on Sunday, up from last Friday’s 44. According to investigations on the mainland, no evidence of human-to-human transmission has been identified, and there are also no known cases of the virus outside Wuhan. In the case of the 20-year-old female student, who is from the mainland and lives on campus, she recently returned from the city in Hubei province, and was sent to Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin on Sunday after complaining of fever and respiratory infection symptoms. She had visited Union Hospital earlier that day but was not kept in care, sparking questions over whether the private hospital had reported her case to authorities. A hospital spokeswoman said staff explained to the student that she should be quarantined at a public hospital after seeing a doctor, but the woman said she would seek medical consultation elsewhere on her own accord. Sources said the student lived on the fifth floor at Bethlehem Hall, a dormitory at United College under Chinese University. The institution confirmed she was eventually sent to hospital for further check-ups on Sunday night and was in a stable condition on Monday. Wuhan pneumonia not Sars, but virus unidentified as more hospitalised Local health authorities said between Sunday and noon on Monday, six more patients who had visited Wuhan in the past two weeks developed pneumonia-related symptoms, including the female student. That brings the total number of suspected cases reported in Hong Kong to 21, of which seven have already been cleared and discharged from hospital. The Centre for Health Protection said the CUHK student was found to have common viruses, including a type of coronavirus unrelated to the cases in Wuhan, while the other five new cases were found to be flu infections or that of known viruses as of Monday. \\n At Bethlehem Hall, which houses 228 students, dormitory staff covered part of their faces on Monday and distributed surgical masks to residents. Year Three student Tristia Wong, 20, who lives on the same floor as the female student with symptoms, said their warden had reminded them not to “stay too long” on that floor, adding staff had already cleaned the entire level with bleach. “I’ve also moved to sleep in a girlfriend’s room on another floor for the moment. Unless it is really necessary, I won’t go back to the fifth floor,” she said. On Monday night, the student union of Lee Woo Sing College, under CUHK, said in a statement that two hostel residents – who are roommates and had gone to Wuhan last month – were sent to a hospital from the dormitory after one of them was coughing but had no fever. A university spokesman confirmed the incident and said the two students had been discharged after undergoing a check-up at a public hospital. At S.H. Ho College, also under CUHK, at least one student who arrived in Hong Kong from Wuhan chose to move into a single room temporarily for isolation, the spokesman added. \\n At University MTR station, which reopened in December after closing for more than a month following vandalism by anti-government protesters, security guards were standing by on Monday, checking staff and students’ IDs before they entered the campus. Much of the 137-hectare campus have been restored but school buses are still operating on temporary routes after most of its 75-vehicle fleet suffered severe damage. Students and staff said they found the tightened security acceptable, as the process only took a few seconds. Administrative worker Jay Ling, 29, said staff who were responsible for student programmes faced pressure after the previous term ended early. “Rescheduling might be needed to catch up,” she said. “But since my work is mainly about office administration, personally I don’t find any major impact.” In a letter to staff and students, Chinese University vice-chancellor and president Rocky Tuan Sung-chi admitted that some inconveniences were expected for the opening period of the second term. “I must ask for your patience and understanding in allowing time for the campus to ease back to its former state of diversity and vibrancy,” he said, adding that greater challenges ahead included rebuilding confidence among university members and stakeholders. On a brighter note, the university has also installed a capsule machine on campus with some 300 small gifts daily to welcome returning students. The feature will be there until Friday. The university, which suffered some of the worst damage during the protests with buildings vandalised and dangerous materials stolen from laboratories, is making repairs worth HK$70 million (US$9 million), including HK$30 million to fix or replace school buses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-06T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-06T12:36:52.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The number of close contacts of cases under medical observation has risen to 163.\nSunday’s statement, the third from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission about the incident, is the first to give information about when people became infected. The first person known to have become ill began to show symptoms on Dec. 12 and the last date of symptom onset among the sick was Dec. 29, the statement said.\nadvertisement\nPreliminary investigations show no clear evidence of person-to-person spread of the infection, and no cases among health workers, the Wuhan authorities said. The latter fact is especially important.\nInfections among medical staff are common at the start of infectious diseases outbreaks, when health workers don’t know they need to take special precautions to protect themselves.\n“I would say that … given the dates that they have mentioned there and the fact that no health care workers have been infected would suggest it’s not transmitting efficiently in humans,” said Ralph Baric, who studies emerging viruses at the University of North Carolina.\nRelated: Experts search for answers in limited information about mystery pneumonia outbreak in China “So it sounds to me like it’s something that’s jumped from animals to humans, and it’s in early stages. And right now it’s virus evolution versus public health control measures to try to prevent spread. That’s what’s going on,” he said.\nThe Wuhan statement listed some pathogens Chinese scientists feel confident are not responsible for this outbreak: regular influenza, avian influenza, adenoviruses (which can cause severe respiratory infections), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or SARS.\nRumors have swirled on social media platforms that the outbreak might be a return of SARS, a disease that exploded from China to touch off outbreaks in multiple Southeast Asian countries and in Toronto, Canada in early 2003. The outbreak was successfully halted in the summer of 2003 and with the exception of a few cases the next year, SARS hasn’t been reported since.\nSymptoms of the current outbreak are mainly fever, though a few patients are having difficulty breathing, the World Health Organization said Sunday in its first update on this outbreak. The WHO said chest X-rays show invasive lesions in both lungs.\nNews of the outbreak emerged on Dec. 31; that is when China alerted the WHO to the findings, the global health agency reported. The following day Chinese authorities closed and decontaminated the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, where some of the infected worked. Despite its name, the market also sells wild animals for meat.\nThe slaughtering of wild animals and preparation of their meat can lead to the transmission of disease. The SARS virus came to humans from civet cats, eaten as a delicacy in southern China. Ebola outbreaks — there is no belief this is one — are often linked to bush meat preparation.\nRelated: The fireman of global health: The WHO’s emergencies chief is put to the test If a new virus is causing the pneumonia cases, it likely comes from birds or animals, not seafood, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy.\nHe praised the Chinese authorities for the information they have make public so far.\n“This much information this early into an outbreak is a very positive thing,” Osterholm said. “I feel confident at this point that the appropriate public health measures are being taken to both investigate the outbreak and to contain it as much as possible…. And I think hopefully over the next several days it will become much clearer what the [causative] agent is.”\nWhile information is emerging, infectious diseases experts watching this outbreak would like more. Baric, for instance, would like to know how old the cases are. Some pathogens cause more severe illness in the elderly or the very young.\n“If they are all 65 year olds, then that starts screaming ‘coronavirus’ to me,” he said.\nOsterholm said it is critical to establish — or share, if one has been established — a case definition. That’s the tool public health officials use to rule in and out possible cases in an outbreak.\nWhen an outbreak triggered by an unknown cause, there is no test. So figuring out a way to differentiate people who are probably part of the outbreak from people who are sick with other viruses is critical.\nUntil then, public health has to throw out a big net, pulling in people who are sick with similar symptoms and who were in Wuhan, but who may in reality have nothing to do with this outbreak.\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine.\nPlease enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human: A report public health authorities in Hong Kong released Sunday shows the problem. They have to date identified 16 suspect cases, all with recent travel to Wuhan. So far 10 of them have tested positive for a mix of known respiratory illnesses — flu, parainfluenza, rhinovirus (the leading cause of the common cold), RSV or respiratory syncytial virus and others.\nSeven of the 16 illnesses were caused by flu, which suggests Wuhan may be in the midst of a flu epidemic, said Marion Koopmans, director of department of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherland. “[I’m] not sure what the testing in Wuhan looks like, but this could still be a pseudo-outbreak if flu activity is high,” she said in an email.\nBut until more is known, potential cases — both in Wuhan and in places further afield — will have to be isolated and monitored. On Sunday, officials in Singapore reported they had identified a suspect case, a 3-year-old Chinese girl who had recently traveled to Wuhan.\n“The good news is they’re aware,” Baric said of the way Chinese authorities have quickly jumped on these suspicious pneumonia cases. “The better news would be if they knew what it was and could provide a diagnostic test … so that every single person who goes from Wuhan to Hong Kong or Singapore who has a fever isn’t suddenly quarantined for [what turns out to be] an RSV infection.”", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/05/cause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say/&#038;mini=true&#038;source=STAT", "https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://statnews.com/2020/01/05/cause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/05/cause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say/&#038;via=statnews&#038;text=Cause+of+Wuhan%E2%80%99s+mysterious+pneumonia+cases+still+unknown%2C+Chinese+officials+say", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "https://doximity.com/inbox/conversations/new_message?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statnews.com%2F2020%2F01%2F05%2Fcause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say%2F&#038;subject=Cause%20of%20Wuhan%E2%80%99s%20mysterious%20pneumonia%20cases%20still%20unknown%2C%20Chinese%20officials%20say", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/05/cause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say", "https://chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/enhanced_sur_pneumonia_wuhan_eng.pdf", "https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/", "https://www.doximity.com/inbox/conversations/new_message?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statnews.com%2F2020%2F01%2F05%2Fcause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say%2F&#038;subject=Cause%20of%20Wuhan%E2%80%99s%20mysterious%20pneumonia%20cases%20still%20unknown%2C%20Chinese%20officials%20say", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://statnews.com/2020/01/05/cause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say/&#038;via=statnews&#038;text=Cause+of+Wuhan%E2%80%99s+mysterious+pneumonia+cases+still+unknown%2C+Chinese+officials+say", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle", "https://www.doximity.com/inbox/conversations/new_message", "https://www.twitter.com/HelenBranswell", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/05/cause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say/", "https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/enhanced_sur_pneumonia_wuhan_eng.pdf", "https://linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://statnews.com/2020/01/05/cause-of-mysterious-pneumonia-cases-still-unknown-chinese-say/&#038;mini=true&#038;source=STAT", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet", "https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell"], "published": "2020-01-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-05T22:49:22.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\n As of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word 'corona,' meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nby signing up you agree to our terms of service The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it's possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\n WHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n'Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,' Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\n0 Comments", "external_links": ["https://embed.secondstreetapp.com/Scripts/dist/optin.js", "https://www.embed.secondstreetapp.com/Scripts/dist/optin.js"], "published": "2020-01-09T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T12:20:57.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said in a statement, adding that it “demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.”\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan’s health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\n___\nStobbe reported from New York.\nCopyright © 2020 The Associated Press.

An outbreak investigation by local officials is ongoing in China; the World Health Organization (WHO) is the lead international public health agency. Currently, there are no known U.S. cases nor have cases been reported in countries other than China. CDC has established an Incident Management Structure to optimize domestic and international coordination if additional public health actions are required.\nThis HAN Advisory informs state and local health departments and health care providers about this outbreak and requests that health care providers ask patients with severe respiratory disease about travel history to Wuhan City. Wuhan City is a major transportation hub about 700 miles south of Beijing with a population of more than 11 million people.\nBackground According to a report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, as of January 5, 2020, the national authorities in China have reported 59 patients with PUE to WHO. The patients had symptom onset dates from December 12 through December 29, 2019. Patients involved in the cluster reportedly have had fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. Of the 59 cases, seven are critically ill, and the remaining patients are in stable condition. No deaths have been reported and no health care providers have been reported to be ill. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not reported human-to-human transmission.\nReports indicate that some of the patients were vendors at the Wuhan South China Seafood City (South China Seafood Wholesale Market) where, in addition to seafood, chickens, bats, marmots, and other wild animals are sold, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin to the outbreak. The market has been closed for cleaning and disinfection. Local authorities have reported negative laboratory test results for seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among patients associated with this cluster. Additional laboratory testing is ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak. Health authorities are monitoring more than 150 contacts of patients for illness.\nCDC has issued a level 1 travel notice (“practice usual precautions”) for this destination. ( https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/pneumonia-china ). On January 5, 2020, WHO posted an update on this situation, including an early risk assessment, which is available at: https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/ external icon .\nRecommendations for Health Care Providers Providers should consider pneumonia related to the cluster for patients with severe respiratory symptoms who traveled to Wuhan since December 1, 2019 and had onset of illness within two weeks of returning, and who do not have another known diagnosis that would explain their illness. Providers should notify infection control personnel and local and state health departments immediately if any patients meet these criteria. State health departments should notify CDC after identifying a case under investigation by calling CDC’s Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100. Multiple respiratory tract specimens should be collected from persons with infections suspected to be associated with this cluster, including nasopharyngeal, nasal, and throat swabs. Patients with severe respiratory disease also should have lower respiratory tract specimens collected, if possible. Consider saving urine, stool, serum, and respiratory pathology specimens if available. Although the etiology and transmissibility have yet to be determined, and to date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported and no health care providers have been reported ill, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to symptomatic patients with a history of travel to Wuhan City. Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed. Personnel entering the room to evaluate the patient should use contact precautions and wear an N95 disposable facepiece respirator. For patients admitted for inpatient care, contact and airborne isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, are recommended until further information becomes available. For additional information see: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html .\nThis guidance will be updated as more information becomes available.\nFor More Information https://www.cdc.gov/cdc-info/index.html CDC’s Emergency Operations Center: 770-488-7100 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects people’s health and safety by preventing and controlling diseases and injuries; enhances health decisions by providing credible information on critical health issues; and promotes healthy living through strong partnerships with local, national and international organizations.

Just two weeks before tens of millions of Chinese travellers hit the road for Lunar New Year , health officials across Asia are scrambling to prevent the spread of a viral pneumonia outbreak in central China. Officials from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur are stockpiling protective gear, preparing isolation beds and even boarding trains to individually screen passengers to contain the virus, which Chinese scientists have identified as a new strain of coronavirus from the same family that caused the 2003 Sars epidemic. The disease, which originated in the provincial capital city of Wuhan, has sickened at least 59 people in China and prompted authorities to revise quarantine rules in Hong Kong , where at least 38 people have received hospital treatment in connection with the virus. The outbreak of a virus in the same family has raised the spectre of the Sars epidemic of 2003 that killed nearly 800 people and sickened thousands. At the time, Chinese officials cut the traditionally week-long May Day national holiday to just one day to discourage people from travelling, but were also criticised for playing down the severity of the outbreak. This time around there are similar suspicions, with public health experts telling the South China Morning Post the true number of victims of the coronavirus outbreak could be higher than officially stated. The outbreak of the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year – often labelled the ‘world’s largest migration’ – has prompted transport authorities in Asia, home to four of the world’s top 10 busiest air transit hubs, to step up temperature screenings and checks on passengers as they prepare for a surge in Chinese tourists at the end of the month. But even with these checks, infectious disease experts warn they have little information to go on. “At this stage, the details that the international medical community have to work with are very limited,” said Masayuki Saijo, head of the virology division of Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases. “We do not have any clinical information on patients.” He added that pressure to monitor arrivals from China and elsewhere in Asia would increase should the illness continue to spread. PREVENTIVE MEASURES In Hong Kong, officials have set up a protocol to board all trains entering from Wuhan and temperature screen inbound passengers. Health authorities across East and Southeast Asia have called for anyone who has recently visited China to report to a doctor immediately if they show symptoms, which include fever and difficulty breathing. Chinese worker in South Korea diagnosed with pneumonia All known patients in China are currently in isolation, and people who have been in close contact with them are being watched for symptoms. On January 1, officials in hazmat suits shut down the seafood wholesale market where some of the patients in Wuhan were employed. The American embassy in China has warned people to stay away from contact with animals as well as raw meat products. Other viruses in the coronavirus family, like SARS as well as avian flu strain H7N9, are suspected to have been initially transmitted to humans from contact with animals and were first detected in markets that sold animal products. \\n Singapore reported its first case on Sunday, a three-year-old girl who had travelled to Wuhan. Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease expert at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital in Singapore, said the country’s infectious disease act allowed the government to apprehend anyone suspected of carrying the illness and keep them in quarantine. Leong said the law could potentially be extended to allow the government to provide free treatment to foreigners if necessary. Leong said hospitals had been directed to ready isolation beds and be prepared to cancel any elective surgeries. “We have been holding annual drills for highly transmissible viruses to prepare,” said Leong, who identified Singapore’s first case of the Zika virus. Singapore reports first suspected pneumonia case linked to Wuhan In Malaysia , Health Ministry Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah announced this week that authorities would implement prevention and control measures at national entry points, and recommended that health officials monitor stock piles of protective equipment. There have been no reports of anyone infected with the mystery illness entering Japan , according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, but authorities there are taking no chances. The health ministry on Wednesday said the cause of the outbreak was “under investigation and there are many uncertainties at this time”. It called for anyone arriving from China with symptoms such as coughing or a high temperature to immediately consult a doctor. Posters in Japanese, Chinese and English were put up at ports and airports across the country with the same advice. LESSONS FROM PAST OUTBREAKS South Korea on Wednesday reported its first suspected case of the illness. According to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), a 36-year-old Chinese woman who had visited Wuhan last month showed symptoms and has been quarantined for treatment. “She is doing fine now,” said a KCDC spokesperson. Authorities are working to prevent a repeat of the notorious 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) epidemic – which is also in the coronavirus family – which afflicted 186 people and caused 36 deaths in the country. Body temperature scanners have been set up at the entry doors for all flights from Wuhan. Some 1,800 passengers have entered South Korea from the Chinese city since Tuesday last week, according to officials. “If passengers turn out to have a high body temperature, they would be asked whether they have visited the Huanan fisheries market in Wuhan and if they did so, they would be immediately put in quarantine,” said an official at the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which has set up a 50-member quarantine task force and warned travellers to Wuhan not to touch wild animals or poultry or visit local markets. Experts say that lessons learned from the Sars outbreak are being applied in China and Japan. The rapid spread of the highly infectious respiratory illness at the time lead authorities to develop protocols that they could rely on now, said Saijo at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. UNKNOWN TRANSMISSION According to infectious disease experts, it is possible the risk of a large outbreak is low if it can be confirmed that the virus is not spread through human to human transmission. “If it is limited in scale, that will make the job a lot easier, but we do have to monitor very closely not only people arriving from Wuhan, but also from other parts of China and even other parts of the world,” said Saijo, who oversees research on some of the world’s most dangerous diseases, including Ebola, Marburg and Lasa haemorrhagic fevers. Leong in Singapore recommended individuals wear a mask to combat the spread of the virus. Chinese state media announced Thursday that scientists had identified the pathogen and confirmed 15 of the patients in China had the new virus. Hong Kong to add Wuhan pneumonia to list of notifiable infectious diseases However, Leong said the level of transparency on the part of authorities in Hong Kong, where authorities quickly kept the public informed about the hospital cases, shows an appropriate level of responsiveness.

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nLaboratory experts as of Wednesday evening had found the novel coronavirus in 15 of those cases, CCTV said, adding that more research must be done before a conclusion is reached.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong and South Korea involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nIn Hong Kong, 15 patients with symptoms of respiratory illness were being treated as of Sunday. And a Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said.\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and the illness spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but none have been reported since 2004. The new illnesses had raised fears of a SARS recurrence.\nAnother coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. That outbreak started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File) The Associated Press\nBy YANAN WANG and MIKE STOBBE\nBEIJING (AP) — A preliminary investigation into viral pneumonia illnesses sickening dozens of people in and around China has identified the possible cause as a new type of coronavirus, state media said Thursday.\nChinese health authorities did not immediately confirm the report from state broadcaster CCTV.\nCoronaviruses are spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person. Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said in a statement, adding that it “demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.”\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\n___\nStobbe reported from New York.\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press .

Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said in a statement, adding that it “demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.”\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\n___\nStobbe reported from New York.\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Jan 9, 2020 10:45 AM By: Canadian Press\nBEIJING — Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\nYanan Wang, The Associated Press This has been shared 0 times 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T18:43:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES? Advertisement\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it’s possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nSubscribe to Federal News Network's In Case You Missed It newsletter for updates on the most important stories of the day.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\nCopyright © 2020 The Associated Press.

Tests run on 15 of those who are unwell suggest that they are all infected with a new coronavirus , in the same family as SARS and MERS.\nSo far, the virus has left at least 59 people unwell in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, with symptoms ranging from fever to difficulty breathing.

Most only cause mild illnesses, but some are more dangerous. Ten per cent of known infections of SARS, for example, were fatal. And MERS, which has spread in the Middle East since 2012, has a fatality rate of 34 per cent .\nThe new virus in China does cause severe illness in some people, according to Chinese authorities: seven of the 59 infected individuals are critically ill. But there are no reported deaths from the infection. Unlike SARS and MERS, the virus doesn’t seem to spread easily between people, but scientists don’t know enough about the virus to be sure.\nSome of the people who have become ill worked at a seafood market in Wuhan, which also sold chickens, bats and other wild mammals – suggesting that the virus may have been spread to people from one of these animals. “The general public should avoid this type of market, and avoid eating wild animals,” says Leo Poon at Hong Kong University.\nThe World Health Organization isn’t recommending any travel or trade restrictions. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a low-level travel notice recommending that travellers to Wuhan avoid animals and contact with sick people, and wash their hands often with soap and water.

The Hong Kong government began its appeal on Thursday against a court’s decision to strike down its anti-mask law by arguing the legislation was justified given the ongoing threat from protests. Benjamin Yu SC said the lower court had failed to fully consider the public danger facing Hong Kong when it ruled the mask ban unconstitutional as a way of curbing unrest, even as radical protesters with their faces covered attacked civilians, property and police. Opening the two-day hearing at the Court of Appeal for the government, Yu said: “That was the daily routine in Hong Kong … Yesterday in Tseung Kwan O, we still had the same problem.” Anti-mask law in Hong Kong ruled unconstitutional by High Court On Wednesday night, protesters mourned the death of student Chow Tsz-lok , who fell from a car park in unexplained circumstances last November near to a police operation. The gathering escalated into clashes with police. Yu acknowledged the mask ban might have left some, including sexual minorities, aggrieved because they could not wear masks to protect their identities even at lawful rallies. But he urged three appeal judges – chief judge of the High Court Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor and Justices Johnson Lam Man-hon and Thomas Au Hing-cheung – to also consider the interests of the wider public. In November, the Court of First Instance ruled unconstitutional an anti-mask law enacted by the government in October to ban people from wearing face coverings at both lawful and unlawful rallies. In a decision that sparked fury in Beijing, the lower court declared as unconstitutional the way in which the government had brought in the mask ban, which was done by invoking the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance on the grounds of public danger. The ban aimed to put an end to the increasing violence seen during months of protests, which were triggered by the government’s now-withdrawn extradition bill. But it led 24 opposition lawmakers and veteran activist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung to challenge the legislation, giving rise to the present court battle. \\n Disagreeing with the lower court, Yu argued the anti-mask law was subsidiary legislation, a set of laws that can be made unilaterally by the government using powers previously granted to it by the legislature. As Hong Kong leader rolls out mask law, city burns during night of violence But the court ruled the emergency law not only allowed the chief executive to make subsidiary legislation, but any laws – of unlimited scope in terms of subject matter – as long as they were desirable in times of public danger. That diminished the legislature’s role, making it incompatible with the Basic Law, the ruling found. Yu said the current administration should be allowed to use the same emergency ordinance previously available to the colonial government, because the Basic Law guaranteed the status quo despite “a change of constitutional order” when Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain in 1997. Otherwise, it would amount to an “earth-shattering change”, he said. \\n He added a preparatory committee, established in the run-up to the handover to screen out colonial laws incompatible with the Basic Law, did not take issue with the emergency ordinance. In the wake of an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, central China, Yu said the anti-mask law provided a defence for those wearing masks for health reasons in public. Barrister Gladys Li SC, representing the legislators, responded saying the “evil” was in the vague wording used in the emergency law which granted the chief executive “untrammelled power”. She added laws made under the emergency regulations ordinance could not in effect be scrutinised by Legco because only the chief executive had the power to repeal it. Li will continue her arguments on Friday. At least 77 anti-mask law arrests amid Hong Kong’s ‘escalating vandalism’ Before the hearing, pro-democracy legislator Dennis Kwok, who led the judicial challenge, called on the government to withdraw the appeal. “We hope the government would understand the anti-mask law has no use whatsoever to resolve the disputes Hong Kong is experiencing right now,” he said. He added the government’s persistence would only lead to deeper social conflicts and urged the administration to let the law “die a natural death”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T12:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T17:52:15.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A preliminary investigation into viral pneumonia ... more Photo: Andy Wong, AP AP Explains: The virus behind China's pneumonia outbreak 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\nBEIJING (AP) — Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

Six strains have been identified so far as sources of human diseases including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and MERS.\nThe other four are not fatal but cause only mild colds. Scientists examine specimens to determine the cause of viral pneumonia from China in a lab in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province on Thursday. /Yonhap\nKim Woo-joo at Korea University Guro Hospital said, \"There's very little possibility of human-to-human transmission unlike SARS and MERS, so it seems to be a less lethal strain since no deaths have been reported and there's been no surge in the number of patients yet.\"\nA 36-year-old Chinese woman has been quarantined at Seoul National University Hospital in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province since Tuesday night right after she was diagnosed at Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital with the first case of the mysterious pneumonia here.\nAn SNU Hospital staffer said she eats normally and is in stable condition.\nTwenty-nine people who had been in contact with her including a coworker who went with her to Wuhan on business on Dec. 13-17 as well as staff at Dongtan hospital have not shown any symptoms, a spokesman for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\nThe results of her virus test will be out within a week, the spokesman added.\nThe KCDC is checking all arrivals from Wuhan for fever, but incubatory carriers may pass through undetected. The Chinese woman had shown no symptoms for 14 days returning from Wuhan.

In several patients, they’ve found a virus never before discovered—albeit one related to the viruses responsible for causing SARS and other respiratory illnesses.\nOn Thursday, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported on the results of a preliminary investigation into the outbreak, which has so far sickened 59 people and left seven in serious condition. In 15 people, scientists say they’ve identified a strong suspect for the illness: a previously unknown type of coronavirus.\nCoronaviruses are a family of spiky ball-shaped viruses known to infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Most coronaviruses that make people sick cause nothing more than a typical cold. But in recent decades, we’ve come across two more dangerous and sometimes lethal viruses—the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and the one that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.\nEarlier this week, the Chinese government stated that the mystery disease was not SARS, following weeks of accusations by its own residents on social media that the government was once again hiding the truth about a SARS outbreak within its borders. According to the Chinese government, no victims have tested positive for other likely culprits either, such as bird flu, while the mystery virus’s genetics have been completely sequenced, ruling out the possibility it’s SARS, MERS, or any other known coronavirus.\nAt this point, the research team’s work has yet to be confirmed independently. But on Wednesday, the World Health Organisation expressed early confidence that the mystery disease could be caused by a coronavirus, based on reports so far.\nThe first human outbreaks of a never-before-seen infection, including SARS and MERS, tend to be zoonotic, meaning they’re initially spread from animals to people (for SARS, it was likely rodents or bats; for MERS, camels). That seems to be the case for this new coronavirus, too. The majority of cases have involved people working at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, where many live animals are kept.\nSometimes, these new viruses are already capable of spreading easily from person to person, or can quickly mutate into a more contagious strain. But at least right now, that’s not true for the mystery bug, since no cases of person-to-person transmission have been reported yet. It also doesn’t seem to be as lethal as SARS or MERS, as no patients have died. But there’s still plenty of questions about the virus left to be answered, including where it first emerged.

According to the WHO, the patient is a 74-year-old male owner of a camel farm with underlying illnesses living in the UAE. Before the onset of symptoms, he had no history of recent travel and had not been involved in the slaughtering of animals, but had a history of close contact with camels. The patient is now receiving treatment in an intensive care unit. He is in a stable condition. According to the WHO, this is the second MERS case reported from the UAE since June 2018. Since 2012, the UAE has reported 89 MERS cases (including the patient reported above), among which 12 patients had passed away. \"We will maintain close communication with the WHO and relevant health authorities,\" a spokesman for the CHP said. \"As countries in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, continue to report MERS cases from time to time, travellers should refrain from going to farms, barns or markets with camels and avoid contact with sick persons and animals, especially camels, birds or poultry. Most of the cases reported in the Middle East had a history of exposure to camels, consumption of camel milk or contact with other MERS patients,\" the spokesman said. \"Scientific evidence showed that camels are reservoirs for MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Camels infected with MERS-CoV may not show any signs of infection. Infected animals may shed MERS-CoV through nasal and eye discharge and faeces, and potentially in their milk and urine. The virus may also be found in the raw organs and meat of infected animals. Therefore, the best protection is to practise good hygiene and avoid direct contact with all of these,\" the spokesman added. From time to time, suspected MERS cases reported to the CHP for investigation involve patients with a history of contact with camels in the Middle East. The CHP strongly advises travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to abstain from arranging camel rides and activities involving direct contact with camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS page of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP's Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the WHO's latest news for more information and health advice. Tour leaders and tour guides operating overseas tours are advised to refer to the CHP's health advice on MERS .", "external_links": ["http://chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/distribution_of_mers_cases_en.pdf", "http://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel", "http://youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel", "http://www.fb.com/CentreforHealthProtection", "http://chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/26551.html", "http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en", "http://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/english/popup/popup.html", "http://chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/26511.html", "http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/26551.html", "http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/distribution_of_mers_cases_en.pdf", "http://travelhealth.gov.hk/english/popup/popup.html", "http://fb.com/CentreforHealthProtection", "http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/26511.html", "http://who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en"], "published": "2020-01-09T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T13:17:30.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Photo by AFP. Vietnam’s Health Ministry has listed several steps for people to protect themselves from a new pneumonia virus that had killed one in China. In a statement released Saturday, the ministry advised residents to keep their distance from people with acute respiratory infections and wear a mask when talking to them. Keeping bodies warm, maintaining personal hygiene, especially cleaning hands regularly with soap and gargling with antiseptic rinse are other steps to take against the virus, it said. People should also cover their mouths and noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing so as to avoid spreading their respiratory tract fluid, and avoid staying close to animal farms or wild animals, it added. Those returning from China’s Wuhan City, where the outbreak has been raging since the beginning of the year, should have their health checked immediately if they catch a fever, cough or have difficulties in breathing, the ministry said. So far, 41 Chinese people in Wuhan have been infected with the virus, which has been identified as a new type of coronavirus by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. One 61-year-old man has died. The man, the first victim of the outbreak, was a regular customer at a seafood market in the city, had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease, local health authorities said. It also noted that the infected people were mainly vendors and buyers at the seafood market. To date, no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found. The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak. While no infection has been recorded to date in Vietnam, Vietnamese health authorities have begun to check those coming in from China through the border gates. Any person found with noticeable symptoms should be quarantined, they have said.

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word 'corona,' meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n'Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,' Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) gives an interview at the Capitol. (Susan Walsh/AP)\nWith Mariana Alfaro\nTHE BIG IDEA: Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) is a former CIA analyst who served three tours in Iraq as one of the American government’s foremost experts on Iranian-backed Shiite militias before being appointed as an assistant secretary of defense with a focus on the Middle East. But that’s not the only experience that motivated Slotkin to draft the resolution limiting President Trump’s ability to take additional military action against Iran without congressional approval, which passed the House last night on a mostly party-line vote.\nThe freshman congresswoman’s son-in-law is an active-duty Army officer whose unit is stationed at the al-Asad air base in western Iraq , which the Iranians hit with 11 ballistic missiles this week in retaliation for the drone strike that killed Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani. Slotkin’s husband also served 30 years in the Army, retiring as a colonel, and her stepdaughter followed in his footsteps. She was not long ago commissioned as an active-duty Army officer.\n“For me, this is not a theoretical exercise,” Slotkin explained on Thursday evening. “If our loved ones are going to be sent to fight in any protracted war, the president owes the American public a conversation. … Congress has long abdicated its responsibility as laid out in the Constitution to make the hard decisions we owe our troops.”\nSuch deeply personal investment in the war effort blunts hyperbolic attacks from Republican lawmakers – especially those who have never served in uniform and don’t have relatives on the battlefield – that opposing the escalation of conflict in the Middle East or supporting Congress asserting its constitutional role is somehow unpatriotic.\nThe debate now moves to the Senate, which could vote as early as next week, where it faces a more uncertain future. At least four Republicans need to vote for the resolution to ensure passage when it comes up, as early as next week. Whatever the Senate passes, if anything, would then need to be approved by the House before going to Trump, who has promised a veto that there would not be the votes to override.\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the lead sponsor of the accompanying resolution in that chamber, isn’t just a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees. Kaine’s oldest son, Nat, is an active-duty Marine infantry officer who has been deployed overseas multiple times.\n-- The Republican messaging machine has gone into overdrive this week, with what has felt at times like a competition among party leaders to see who could offer up the most incendiary quote questioning the motives of Democratic lawmakers concerned about the possibility of a full-scale war against Iran without congressional approval.\n“This is a meaningless vote that only sends the wrong message that the House Democrats would rather stand with the socialist base than stand against Iran,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said at his weekly news conference on Thursday.\n“Whether you mean to or not, you’re empowering the enemy,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to lawmakers who vote for the resolution.\n“They are in love with terrorists,” said Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. “We see that they mourn Soleimani more than they mourn our Gold Star families,” Collins told Lou Dobbs on Fox Business .\n-- Democrats have decided not to just brush aside comments like this. “I left literal parts of my body in Iraq, where I was fighting terrorists,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who has used a wheelchair since her Black Hawk helicopter was shot down over Iraq in 2004. “Donald Trump spent months attacking an ACTUAL Gold Star Family,” she added on Twitter. “[Collins] should be ashamed of himself for perpetuating this offensive lie.”\nDuckworth is referring to when Trump, who received a deferment for “bone spurs” to avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War, mocked Khizr and Ghazala Khan. Their son Humayun was killed in action as an Army captain in Iraq. The Khans spoke out against Trump at the Democratic convention in 2016, expressing concern about his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n-- Collins apologized this morning. “Let me be clear: I do not believe Democrats are in love with terrorists,” he tweeted . “As someone who served in Iraq in 2008, I witnessed firsthand the brutal death of countless soldiers who were torn to shreds by this vicious terrorist. Soleimani was nothing less than an evil mastermind who viciously killed and wounded thousands of Americans. These images will live with me for the rest of my life, but that does not excuse my response on Wednesday evening.”\n-- During the Thursday evening debate on the House floor, several Democrats emphasized their credentials as they made the case for the war powers resolution. Polls suggest that Democrats have tightened their traditional gap on which party is more trusted to handle national security. They won control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections thanks, in part, to a large cohort of young military veterans in swing districts. There are 96 veterans in this Congress , including 30 Democrats and 66 Republicans.\nOne of those freshmen who delivered the majority is Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.). He defeated a GOP incumbent in the Denver suburbs by touting his Army combat experience. “I have often heard folks say that now is not the time to discuss the use of force or the decision to send our men and women to fight,” said Crow. “I heard that in 2003 when I was carrying a rifle in Baghdad. I heard it again in 2004 and 2005 when I was leading my unit through the mountains of Afghanistan. And I am hearing it again today in the halls of Congress. In the last 19 years, more than 7,000 Americans have given their lives in these conflicts, 53,000 have been wounded and we have spent over $4 trillion dollars of taxpayer money.\n“Do not believe the fearmongering,” Crow concluded. “I may have laid down my rifle, but my oath to this country endures. I will fight to ensure that we are having a discussion about when to send our men and women, our sons and daughters, our sisters and brothers, into harm’s way.”\n-- Slotkin left her Pentagon job to move home to Michigan after Trump took office. Then she toppled a longtime GOP incumbent the next year in the midterms. She faces a tough reelection battle this fall in a district Trump carried comfortably in 2016. The National Republican Congressional Committee has taken to calling her “pro-Iran Slotkin” in news releases. “Sit down, Elissa,” one missive from the House GOP campaign arm said this week.\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the former vice president’s daughter, called into a news talk radio station in Slotkin’s district on Thursday morning to attack her for the “appalling” resolution, which she said “will send a message to the Iranians that the country is not united behind the president.” Cheney told WILS in Lansing, Mich. , that Slotkin’s resolution showed “there’s a big difference between what she’s saying at home and what she does when she gets here to Washington.”\nIn a speech on the House floor before the vote on resolution, Slotkin pushed back forcefully on these criticisms. “Soleimani was the lead architect of much of Iran’s destabilizing activities in the Middle East and throughout the world,” she said. “To that end, with Iran, or with any other adversary, the United States always has the inherent right and obligation to self-defense against imminent armed attacks. Always!”\nSlotkin lamented that the country has been at war for nearly two decades, but Congress has only voted twice in that time to authorize the use of military force: in 2001 and 2002. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was the lone member of Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force immediately after the 9/11 attacks, which is still being cited more than 18 years later as a legal rationale for U.S. activities in the Middle East. Only 1 in 4 House members today were in Congress back then .\nThat 2001 authorization has been cited dozens of times, by three different presidents now, to justify deploying American troops to a list of countries that includes Libya, Turkey, Georgia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, the Philippines and Cuba. The language of Slotkin’s nonbinding resolution instructs Trump “to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its government or military” unless Congress either formally declares war or there is “an imminent armed attack upon the United States.”\n“When it comes to the matter of longer-term war, we have a constitutional responsibility to authorize the use of military force,” Slotkin reasoned. “The framers of our Constitution rightly believed that the power to declare war belongs in the Congress because this would ensure that the American people, through the legislators they elected, would weigh the most significant decision a government can make.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) walks in the Capitol after casting his vote on the House floor. (Matt Rourke/AP)\n-- Slotkin’s resolution passed 224 to 194, with the support of three Republicans plus independent Justin Amash of Michigan and the opposition of eight Democrats. The most notable vote for the resolution came from Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of Trump’s most outspoken allies on Capitol Hill. “I take a back seat to no member of this body when it comes to defending the president,” he said in a floor speech shortly before the vote. “This resolution offers no criticism of the president. It doesn’t criticize the president’s attacks on Soleimani. As a matter of fact, this resolution doesn’t even say Soleimani’s name in it.”\nGaetz’s district includes the naval air station in Pensacola, Fla. “I represent more troops than any other member of this body,” he said. “I buried one of them earlier today at Arlington, and that sergeant died a patriot and a hero. If the members of our armed services have the courage to go fight and die in these wars, as Congress we ought to have the courage to vote for them or against them. It’s ludicrous to suggest that we are impairing the troops from doing their job by not doing our job articulated in the Constitution.”\nThe other Republicans who voted for Slotkin’s resolution were Rep. Francis Rooney (Fla.), who is retiring, and Rep. Tom Massie (Ky.), a libertarian-minded iconoclast.\nTwo of the eight Democrats who voted against it are freshmen who served in the armed forces : Reps. Elaine Luria (Va.) and Max Rose (N.Y.). And Rep. Stephanie Murphy (Fla.) was formerly a national security specialist at the Defense Department. The others who voted no are moderates from difficult-to-win districts, including Ben McAdams (Utah), Anthony Brindisi (N.Y.), Joe Cunningham (S.C.), Kendra Horn (Okla.) and Josh Gottheimer (N.J.).\n-- Trump ripped the Slotkin resolution during a rally last night in Toledo, Ohio, insisting he doesn’t need to get permission from Congress to protect America. “[Soleimani] was a bloodthirsty terrorist … and he's no longer a terrorist. He's dead, and yet now I see ... the radical-left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist,” the president said. “Instead, they should be outraged by Soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long.”\nTrump singled out Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who as the leader of the House Intelligence Committee,is a member of the Gang of Eight that’s entitled to briefings on the nation’s biggest secrets. Schiff spearheaded the investigation that led to Trump’s impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and the congressman has clearly gotten under the president’s skin. “You little pencil neck,” Trump said, referring to Schiff. Trump claimed, with no evidence whatsoever, that Schiff would have called CNN ahead of the drone strike on Soleimani to tip them off and that this would have allowed the Quds Force commander to get away. “They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media,” he said, referring to House Democrats.\nSlotkin’s resolution explicitly makes an exception for defending against “an imminent armed attack,” but Trump ignored this as he complained about Democrats trying to stop him from taking action if there’s an imminent threat. “He was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in Baghdad, but we stopped him very quickly and we stopped him cold,” the president told a crowd of nearly 8,000 supporters, referring to Soleimani. “We didn’t have time to call up Nancy [Pelosi], who is not operating with a full deck.”\nQUOTE OF THE DAY:\n“It’s not about how bad they are. It’s about how good we are,” Pelosi said at her weekly news conference, referring to Iran and Soleimani. ( Felicia Sonmez ) Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) heads to the Senate floor for a vote. (Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n-- In the Senate, two Republicans have committed to support Kaine’s resolution: Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Rand Paul (Ky.). Kaine is trying to woo at least two more GOP colleagues by offering to make amendments that could get them on board. He’s actively discussing draft text with Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Todd Young (Ind.). Kaine has already agreed to remove any references to Trump by name to make it more palatable for Republican colleagues, and he’s willing to make more edits. “It doesn’t mean everyone I talk to will get on board, but me sitting down with them and talking them through why I’ve done it this way, it gives them some level of comfort,” Kaine told Jenna Portnoy .\nKaine vocally pushed to get Congress to authorize the use of military force in the Middle East even when his good friend Barack Obama was president. ( Read my piece about it from 2015 here ). In fact, Kaine refused to modulate his position even when Hillary Clinton chose him as her running mate. His longtime emphasis on this issue undermines the GOP argument that his resolution is politically motivated.\nKeep an eye on Young, who happens to be chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. I wrote a Big Idea in May about how Young’s military service prompted him to focus on this issue when it looked like the United States might get drawn into a war with Venezuela.\n“I understand — as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer — the real-world limitations to and the sensitivities associated with sharing certain information, even with members of Congress,” Young told Seung Min Kim , referring to the closed-door briefing on Wednesday that left Lee and Paul seething. “But I left there feeling as though it would’ve been a lot more helpful had I gotten a little peek into some of the intel that informed the operational decisions.”\nTHE LATEST ON THE IRAN CRISIS:\n-- In a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi asked the United States to send a delegation to Iraq to set up a mechanism for the “safe withdrawal of forces from Iraq.” Sarah Dadouch reports : “The Iraqi prime minister has repeatedly insisted that U.S. troop withdrawal was the only path toward de-escalation. … According to a statement, Abdul Mahdi also shared his objections regarding U.S. forces entering Iraq and American aircraft flying in Iraqi airspace without the consent of the Iraqi government.”\n-- The Trump administration hit Iran with more sanctions Friday in the first concrete response to the attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq this week. ( Carol Morello )\n-- Western officials believe an Iranian missile hit the Ukrainian plane that crashed near Tehran earlier this week in a possible unintentional firing. Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky is now asking Western leaders to share with him the intelligence that suggests this. Isabelle Khurshudyan and Erin Cunningham report: “Iran, meanwhile, denied the assertions that the Boeing 737, carrying 176 people from Tehran to Kyiv, was shot down early Wednesday shortly after departing from Tehran. … Ukraine has taken an active role in investigating the crash of the jet, which was carrying 11 Ukrainians, including the crew. A team of 45 experts and search-and-rescue personnel from Ukraine, including specialists who helped investigate the July 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukrainian territory, arrived in Tehran early Thursday to participate in the probe. … Zelensky had phone conversations Thursday with heads of government from Canada, Britain, Sweden and Iran — countries that each had citizens among the passengers. While Ukraine’s readouts of those calls said Zelensky intended to keep the leaders abreast of Ukraine’s findings and encouraged their countries to participate in the investigation, he has now had to publicly ask to be briefed in return. … The Ukrainian leader is expected to speak with [Pompeo] on Friday. …\n“In Washington, U.S. officials expressed ‘high confidence’ that the Boeing 737-800 was targeted by an SA-15 surface-to-air missile, part of a Russian-made air defense system also known as a Tor system, as Iranian forces were on high alert. President Trump said the downing of the aircraft was probably a ‘mistake.’ Then in Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said intelligence analyses indicated that a surface-to-air missile hit the plane in what could have been an ‘unintentional’ act. … A Ukrainian official … said that Zelensky made the public request for evidence about the crash because the United States had not yet shared with Ukraine its intelligence about the missile Thursday. …\n\"The Washington Post obtained a video that allegedly shows the moment the airliner was struck in midair. The video, first published by the New York Times, purportedly shows a missile intercepting the aircraft near the city of Parand, followed by a loud boom. … Earlier Friday, the Iranian government said in a statement that it was inviting Boeing to send a representative to help examine the ‘black box’ containing the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. Iranian state television aired a video of an investigator opening and showing the contents of the box.”\n-- The tragedy mirrors the 1988 Iran Air incident, in which a passenger plane that had originated in the Iranian capital was shot down, leaving 290 dead. Adam Taylor reports : “On July 3, 1988, Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down by the U.S. military. The flight ... was flying over the Strait of Hormuz toward its destination, Dubai, when it was hit by two surface-to-air missiles. Though Pentagon officials at first denied any knowledge of the incident, it soon emerged that the plane had been targeted by the USS Vincennes, a cruiser that had been involved in a skirmish with Iranian boats in the Persian Gulf and had mistaken the passenger jet for an Iranian warplane. President Ronald Reagan expressed sympathy for the ‘terrible human tragedy’ but suggested that the plane had ‘failed to heed repeated warnings.’ However, an investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency, found that U.S. military ships in the region did not have the equipment necessary to monitor civilian air-traffic-control frequencies.”\n-- On Fox News last night , Pompeo reiterated that Soleimani planned “a series of imminent attacks.” Asked for specifics, he added: “We don’t know precisely when and we don’t know precisely where. But it was real.”\n-- An Iranian military commander said the missiles fired at bases used by U.S. troops in Iraq were not intended to inflict casualties. Kareem Fahim and Sarah Dadouch report : “‘We did not intend to kill,’ said Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s Aerospace Force, according to Iranian state media. ‘We intended to hit the enemy’s military machinery.’ However, he repeated the government’s claim that ‘tens of people were killed or wounded.’ U.S. and Iraqi officials said the strikes caused no casualties. … Iran tried to counter the United States on the diplomatic front Thursday after Trump called on Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China to ‘break away from the remnants’ of the 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers. ... British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday, ‘underlined the UK’s continued commitment to’ the nuclear deal and ‘ongoing dialogue to avoid nuclear proliferation and reduce tensions,’ according to a British government statement. Rouhani also called European Council President Charles Michel asking for a response to U.S. sanctions, which Rouhani described as ‘economic terrorism,' the Iranian Fars News agency reported. In a statement, Michel emphasized the need for de-escalation in the region.”\n-- The U.S. strike on Soleimani’s convoy last week also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of an Iraqi paramilitary group, whose death could have far-reaching implications. From Middle East Eye: “Commanders of Iranian-backed armed factions in Iraq tell MEE that with the loss of the two leaders, they are now almost paralysed and would be unable to strike the Americans with real consequence. … Muhandis, who since the 1980s has been one of America’s most wanted men over his involvement in the bombing of the US and French embassies in Kuwait, was seen by most Iraqis as Iran’s most influential man in the country. … Although formally stripped of his financial and administrative powers, Muhandis continued to enjoy great influence over most of the Hashd al-Shaabi’s armed factions, with the government unable to regain control over the paramilitary umbrella group or force Muhandis to implement orders for fear of retaliation. … While he frustrated the government, it was Muhandis’ strong personality, and his blatant challenge to it and the rest of his opponents, that so attracted the leaders and fighters of the armed factions and kept them revolving around him like moths to a flame, following wherever he went.”\n-- The speed at which the Iran crisis unfolded shows the influence Trump’s new team of national security advisers has. From the Journal : “The group, including new Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and new national security adviser Robert O’Brien, along with [Pompeo], backed the president’s decision to kill the top Iranian military commander and moved swiftly to carry it out. The new team was cohesive and less inclined than its predecessors to push back against the president’s wishes, according to administration officials and others consulted by the White House. They also were less likely to consult in advance with other administration, Pentagon or State Department officials, congressional leaders or foreign allies, some of these officials said.”\n-- Informants in Iraq and Syria helped the United States kill Soleimani. From Reuters: “Soleimani arrived at the Damascus airport in a vehicle with dark-tinted glass. … They parked near a staircase leading to a Cham Wings Airbus A320, destined for Baghdad. Neither Soleimani nor the soldiers were registered on the passenger manifesto. … The passenger flight would be Soleimani’s last. … Investigators have focused on how suspected informants inside the Damascus and Baghdad airports collaborated with the U.S. military to help track and pinpoint Soleimani’s position. … The suspects include two security staffers at the Baghdad airport and two Cham Wings employees. … The National Security agency’s investigators believe the four suspects, who have not been arrested, worked as part of a wider group of people feeding information to the U.S. military, the official said.”\n-- For Trump and Iran, Twitter trolling helped escalate tensions on the battlefield. David Nakamura reports : “A day after [Trump] signaled he would not use military force to escalate a tense standoff with Iran, that nation’s supreme leader responded with a message of his own: a doctored photo of Trump’s face imprinted with red welts from a slap to the face. The creation on the official website of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered a trolling visual meme to echo his previous warning that Tehran’s missile attack on two Iraqi facilities housing U.S. troops was only the first salvo in a campaign to avenge the drone killing of [Soleimani.] … Experts called the display an example of a new era in international diplomacy in which official letters, telephone hotlines and secure video conference calls have been replaced, in some cases, by high-octane and instantaneous social media messaging.”\n-- Notable commentary from The Post's opinion page: Jim Webb, former Democratic senator from Virginia and secretary of the Navy under Reagan: “When did it become acceptable to kill a top leader of a country we aren’t even at war with?” Andrew McCabe , former deputy director of the FBI: “If you think Iran is done retaliating, think again.” Fareed Zakaria : “Trump does not have a foreign policy. He has a series of impulses.” David Ignatius : “This is what a real Iran strategy would look like.” Eugene Robinson: “The best Iran crisis explanation? Trump’s obsession with Obama.” Josh Rogin : “Soleimani’s death offers a chance to fix U.S. policy on Syria.” Max Boot: “By claiming Democrats support terrorism, Republicans hit a new low.” A hilarious satire by Alexandra Petri : “Millions of Americans devastated to learn they were ardent fans of Soleimani this whole time.” Subscribe on Amazon Echo , Google Home , Apple HomePod and other podcast players.

( Our live blog has more. )\n-- The Senate has conducted 15 impeachment trials in U.S. history. It has heard witnesses in every single one. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, reviews the history: “Only 19 other individuals besides Trump have been impeached by the House of Representatives. The Senate completed a trial in 15 of those cases, and in every single one of them, it heard testimony from witnesses. Those cases include the only two prior instances in which a president was impeached.”\n-- House Republicans are eyeing a push to condemn Pelosi for delaying the trial. From Politico : “GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne, who is running for an Alabama Senate seat, introduced a censure resolution on Thursday morning to rebuke Pelosi for hanging on to the articles of impeachment since December. Republicans have the option to force a floor vote on the measure though Democrats would surely move to table it, just as they did with a censure resolution against” Schiff.\n-- Meanwhile, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) tweeted an impeachment-related fundraising appeal that included a doctored photo of Pelosi, drawing a retweet from Trump. Felicia Sonmez reports : “The tweet marks the second time this week that a House Republican has tweeted a photo that appears to have been manipulated. On Monday, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) tweeted a fake photo of Obama with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. … The tweet shows a close-up, red-tinted photo of Pelosi, with the lines in the House speaker’s face exaggerated due to the image’s unnaturally high contrast.\" Matt Golsteyn is pictured in his D.C. office with his wife Julie and their infant son Henry. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n-- An Army general denied a request by an officer pardoned by Trump in an open murder case to have his Special Forces tab reinstated. Dan Lamothe reports : “The decoration for retired Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn was denied Dec. 3 by Lt. Gen. Francis M. Beaudette, the commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command, the Army disclosed Thursday. Beaudette’s decision is not final, and the service said in a statement that it will next have an administrative panel consider whether it should reinstate the Special Forces tab and a Distinguished Service Cross — the U.S. military’s ­second-highest valor award — and expunge a letter of reprimand Golsteyn received in connection with his case. Golsteyn was awaiting trial this year in the alleged murder of a suspected Taliban bombmaker in Marja, Afghanistan, in February 2010. … The general’s denial of Golsteyn’s reinstatement request follows Trump’s decision in November to pardon Golsteyn along with former 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, an Army officer who had been convicted of murder in Afghanistan. … Golsteyn, reached for comment Thursday evening, said he had not heard about the decision until it was first reported by The Washington Post. A few minutes later, he and his lawyer, Phil Stackhouse, said they received notification from the Army in an emailed letter that had just arrived.”\n-- The Justice Department is winding down the Hillary Clinton-related inquiry once championed by Trump. It found nothing of consequence. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: “John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, was tapped in November 2017 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to look into concerns raised by Trump and his allies in Congress that the FBI had not fully pursued cases of possible corruption at the Clinton Foundation and during Clinton’s time as secretary of state, when the U.S. government decided not to block the sale of a company called Uranium One. As a part of his review, Huber examined documents and conferred with federal law enforcement officials in Little Rock who were handling a meandering probe into the Clinton Foundation. ... Current and former officials said that Huber has largely finished and found nothing worth pursuing — though the assignment has not formally ended and no official notice has been sent to the Justice Department or to lawmakers.”\n-- Internal Boeing documents show employees discussing efforts to manipulate U.S. and international safety regulators. Ian Duncan, Lori Aratani and Michael Laris report : “‘Yes, I still haven’t been forgiven by god for the covering up I did last year,” said a 2018 message. Another exchange between Boeing employees, from August 2015, closes out with this: ‘I know but this is what these regulators get when they try and get in the way. they impede progress. ...' In 2017, a Boeing employee wrote: ‘this airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.’ The documents were released by Boeing to congressional investigators probing how the company’s 737 Max jets were certified by the Federal Aviation Administration as safe before two crashes that killed 346 people. …\n“ At issue in some of the messages was whether simulator training should be required for pilots flying the Max. Boeing went to great lengths to prevent such a requirement, in part because it would be costly for its customers, company documents show. … In one November 2015 message, the 737 chief technical pilot, whose name is redacted in the documents, said failing to get computer-based training for one system ‘is a planet-killer for the MAX.’ … In another email chain, from June 2017, the chief technical pilot forwarded to Boeing colleagues messages in which he persuaded an airline, which is not identified in the documents, not to require simulator training on the Max. ‘Looks like my jedi mind trick worked again!’ the pilot wrote. ‘These are not the droids you’re looking for.’ … In a shift Tuesday, the company said that it is recommending that pilots undergo simulator training before they resume flying the 737 Max. The FAA, which will have the final say, said it will consider Boeing’s recommendation.” ( Read the Boeing documents for yourself here. )\n-- The United States economy added 145,000 jobs in December as the unemployment rate remained at 3.5 percent. ( Rachel Siegel )\n-- Video from Jeffrey Epstein’s first apparent suicide attempt was lost due to “technical errors,” according to prosecutors. Reis Thebault reports : “Federal prosecutors said in December they were unable to locate the video, which would have showed guards finding Epstein after his first apparent suicide attempt in July. Then, just a day later, they wrote in a court filing that they had found the footage and were ‘in the process of obtaining a copy’ from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City, where Epstein was held. But on Thursday, prosecutors reversed themselves again, saying the video ‘no longer exists’ because of ‘technical errors.’ Jail officials initially thought they had saved footage from outside Epstein’s cell, when in fact the footage they preserved was from a different part of the facility, explained Assistant U.S. Attorneys Maurene Comey and Jason Swergold in the latest filing.”\n-- Border crossings are starting to plateau as U.S. officials report a continued decline in immigration apprehensions. Abigail Hauslohner reports : “The number of people apprehended or deemed ‘inadmissible’ by U.S. border authorities along the southern border fell to 40,620 last month, down 72 percent from May, when the Trump administration declared it was at the height of a border crisis. December marked the seventh straight month of decline in border crossings, but the month-to-month differences have shrunk significantly since September. Border enforcement actions last month were roughly on par with December 2017.”\n-- Counties, cities and states are stepping up on their climate goals as the Trump administration steps back. Rebecca Tan reports: “Maryland’s most populous jurisdiction is promising an ambitious package of new climate initiatives in 2020, joining other liberal counties, cities and states stepping up to address what they see as the Trump administration’s resistance to protecting the planet. … In February, Montgomery will hold a town hall on hundreds of recommendations from climate workgroups convened last year by County Executive Marc Elrich (D). And by early 2021, officials hope to unveil a comprehensive plan detailing how the county will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2027 and 100 percent by 2035.” American sprinters Tommie Smith (center) and John Carlos (right) raise their gloved fists in a civil rights protest at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. (AP)\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n-- Gag rule alert: The International Olympic Committee warned athletes they would face sanctions, which could include the loss of medals, for participating in political protests during the Olympics in Tokyo this summer, including kneeling, political hand gestures and wearing or holding signs or armbands. Jacob Bogage reports: “The committee published a three-page document of guidelines . ... ‘We needed clarity, and they wanted clarity on the rules,’ [ said ] Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, chair of the IOC Athletes’ Commission, which helped create the new document. ... The guidelines outlaw demonstrations such as those staged by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, American sprinters who raised their gloved fists on the medal stand at the 1968 Games in Mexico City, and former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who in 2016 began kneeling during the national anthem. Both demonstrations sought to draw attention to racial injustice and have been repeated by other athletes in recent years. …\n“ Ethiopian runner Feyisa Lilesa crossed his wrists at the finish line of the men’s marathon at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro to show support for civil rights protesters in his home country. Americans Race Imboden, a fencer, and hammer-thrower Gwen Berry were placed on probation by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee in August after demonstrating on the medal stand at the Pan American Games. Imboden knelt during the national anthem, while Berry raised a fist. Athletes who protest will face discipline ‘on a case-by-case basis as necessary,’ according to the guidelines.”\n­ -- A billion animals have been caught in Australia’s fires. Some may go extinct. Karin Brulliard and Darryl Fears report: “The mouse-size dunnart is not as iconic as the koalas or platypuses that draw tourists, but it is arguably the most special mammal on Australia’s Kangaroo Island. Now the Kangaroo Island dunnart’s days may be numbered. Before bush fires struck, it was already endangered, so rare that even researchers who studied them had never seen one. Now they fear they never will. One-third of the 1,700-square-mile island has burned, including the entire area where these dunnarts are known to live. … More than 1 billion mammals, birds and reptiles nationwide — some of them found nowhere else on Earth — may have been affected or killed by the fires sweeping across Australia, according to a University of Sydney estimate. The potential toll is far greater when other types of animals are included. … Individual animals might survive, but when their habitat is gone, ‘it doesn’t matter,’ Saunders said. ‘They’ll die anyway.’”\n-- Disgusting: Hoaxers are using the fires to spread misinformation and profit, Brittany Shammas reports .\n-- The fire crisis is fueling protests calling for bolder action on climate change. Kate Shuttleworth reports: “At rallies nationwide on Friday, thousands called for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to resign over what they say is his administration’s passivity on an issue that has hit home to millions of Australians as a clear and present danger. The conservative leader has defended his disaster response after facing criticism from victims and firefighters for its perceived inadequacy. In Melbourne, close to 10,000 people took to the streets, spurning calls from police and the state’s center-left leader, Daniel Andrews, not to risk diverting emergency resources. … An organizer of a similar rally in Sydney, Gavin Stanbrook, said the events of recent weeks revealed a nation polarized over how to tackle the challenge. ‘We are divided between coal interests and politicians on the one side and then firefighters and volunteers on the other and the rest of us who are either impacted or our friends and family are on the front line, or in cities surrounded by smoke,’ Stanbrook said. ‘We need to come together and say that we will not accept it anymore.’”\n-- Suspected Islamist militants killed 25 soldiers in Niger. Danielle Paquette reports: “The clash unfolded in the western village of Chinegodar near the border with Mali, according to Nigerien defense officials, as fighters with ties to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda look to seize new swaths of territory. The bloodshed came about a month after gunmen ambushed a Nigerien army post in another border town, killing 71 soldiers in the deadliest strike on the nation’s forces in recent memory. The Islamic State West Africa Province asserted responsibility for that massacre two days later.”\n-- In Israel, deadly floods have kept residents confined to their homes and offices even as they braced for potential spinoff attacks from rising tensions between the United States and Iran. Steve Hendrix reports : “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday beseeched citizens to take flood warnings as seriously as they do the sirens warning of imminent rocket fire that are a feature of life in many Israeli communities. … Netanyahu also warned the adventurous not to venture out to the desert to witness the dramatic — and potentially dangerous — spectacle of dry stream beds reanimated with roaring water. ‘Watch them on television,’ he advised. … Officials said rescue resources had been redeployed nationwide in response to the flooding, which stretched from the coastal plains along the Mediterranean to the occupied West Bank down to the Dead Sea.”\n-- China identified a new strain of coronavirus as the source of its pneumonia outbreak. Gerry Shih and Lena H. Sun report: “A group of Chinese experts this week isolated and obtained the genome sequence of the new virus, which is believed to be responsible for sickening dozens of people who visited a wild-animal market last month in Wuhan, in central China, state media reported Thursday. The outbreak ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season in China has prompted health authorities across East Asia to increase screening of travelers for signs of fever, underscoring fears about its potential spread.”\n-- Understatement of the year? Pope Francis said 2020 is off to a rough start, saying it “does not seem to be marked by encouraging signs.” Chico Harlan reports : “While saying that maintaining hope is essential, the pope spent the next 45 minutes talking about wars and could-be wars, exploitation, sexual abuse, Internet hate speech, international indifference to humanitarian crises, and the depressing state of the world’s fight against climate change. He called heightened tensions between the United States and Iran ‘particularly troubling,’ but his remarks amounted to a laundry list of flash points, both major and obscure, from Burkina Faso to Venezuela to Australia. ‘Certainly, hope has to be realistic,’ Francis said. ‘It demands acknowledging the many troubling issues confronting our world and the challenges lurking on the horizon. It requires that problems be called by their name and the courage be found to resolve them.’”\n-- Lebanon has banned ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn from traveling. Sarah Dadouch reports : “Ghosn appeared at a hearing in Lebanon on Thursday, two days after Lebanon’s caretaker justice minister, Albert Serhan, said the country’s public prosecutor had received the Interpol red notice about Ghosn and would be taking the necessary steps. He was placed under house arrest. A few days after his arrival in Lebanon’s capital, Ghosn found himself in more legal trouble: A group of lawyers last Thursday lodged a legal complaint against him for visiting Israel as chairman of Renault and later Nissan. Lebanon and Israel have been in a state of war for the past six decades, and Lebanese law considers interacting with the country’s southern neighbor and sworn enemy a crime. Ali Abbas, one of the two lawyers who filed the Israel-related complaint against Ghosn, said the travel ban was a formality that usually comes after receiving Interpol notices, especially red notices, which alert police about internationally wanted fugitives but do not compel any country to arrest the fugitive.” -- Trump wished North Korean leader Kim Jung Un a happy birthday through South Korea. ( AP )\n-- A statue mocking Trump in Melania Trump’s home country was burned down. Lateshia Beachum reports: “Firefighters in Moravce, a city in central Slovenia, tried to extinguish the bonfire, but their efforts left charred planks on the ground. The arsonists responsible for the Christmas nutcracker-like statue’s ashes are reportedly still at large. The nearly 26-foot tall wooden structure that had a mechanism to open Trump’s red painted mouth full of pointy teeth was constructed last year in a nation divided over the U.S. president. The statue of Trump, with the president’s signature blue suit and red tie, had been under torch threats since local residents threatened to set it ablaze on Halloween ... It was relocated because of the risk.”\n-- London’s Madame Tussauds removed its wax figures of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, from its display of Britain’s royal family less than 24 hours after the couple announced they would be “stepping back” from their roles as senior royals. Jennifer Hassan reports: “The figures will no longer stand alongside the rest of the royal family. They have been moved by the wax museum’s staff. The likenesses of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Catherine, remain on display alongside figures of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip. ‘As two of our most popular and well-loved figures, they will of course remain an important feature at Madame Tussauds London as we watch to see what the next chapter holds for them,’ said [Steve Davies, general manager of Madame Tussauds London].” Vice President Pence, along with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, and their children, Arabella, Joseph and Theodore Kushner, attend a Hanukkah reception in the East Room of the White House last month. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n2020 WATCH:\n-- Jared Kushner’s global role is shrinking as his role in the president’s reelection campaign grows. From Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman in the Times : “When senior administration officials gathered in the Situation Room on Tuesday for a meeting to discuss the repercussions of the killing of [Soleimani], the White House aide whose portfolio is the Middle East was notably absent from the meeting. … [He] was sitting for a photo shoot for a planned Time magazine cover story. … [Kushner] is positioning himself to be the overseer of something of even greater personal interest to his father-in-law: Mr. Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. … [Kushner] sees no reason to involve himself as extensively in international issues now that the State Department is run by [Mike] Pompeo, whom he sees as far more competent than his predecessor, Rex W. Tillerson.”\n-- Mike Bloomberg won’t release the women who sued him from their nondisclosure agreements. From ABC News : “‘You can't just walk away from it,’ Bloomberg said. ‘They're legal agreements, and for all I know the other side wouldn't want to get out of it.’ Last month, ABC News reported on several lawsuits in which Bloomberg was accused of making crude remarks in the 1990s and of allegedly fostering an uncomfortable environment for women to work — allegations Bloomberg has denied. Three cases against the company remain active. ABC News has spoken with several women who expressed interest in telling their stories who were subject to confidentiality agreements, but said they feared the prospect of facing retribution from the company for speaking out.”\n-- Tom Steyer appears to have qualified for the seventh Democratic debate, scheduled for next Tuesday night in Iowa, on the strength of Fox News polls that found him with double-digit support in Nevada and South Carolina. David Weigel reports: “Steyer, who has spent more than $115 million on his campaign so far, hit 12 percent in the network’s poll of Nevada … and 15 percent in South Carolina. … It came after Steyer poured more than $20 million into commercials and other advertising in these states as of this week, with $11.2 million worth of expenditures in South Carolina and $10.3 million in Nevada. He has also spent heavily to attract hundreds of thousands of small-dollar donations, which the DNC requires for debate access.”\n-- The Fox News Nevada poll also shows Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders vying for the lead in the state: “Biden tops Sanders by 23-17 percent among Democratic caucusgoers, with both down one percentage point since November. [Elizabeth] Warren comes in at 12 percent, down from 18 percent — and ties with [Steyer] for third.”\n-- A new Monmouth Poll shows a four-way fight in the New Hampshire Democratic primary: “Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 20% currently support [Pete] Buttigieg, 19% back Biden, 18% back Sanders, and 15% back Warren. … Compared to Monmouth’s last New Hampshire poll in September, Buttigieg’s support has grown by 10 points (from 10%) and Sanders’ support has increased by 6 points (from 12%). Warren’s support has dropped by 12 points (from 27%) and Biden’s has decreased by 6 points (from 25%).\"\n-- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti endorsed Biden. From the Los Angeles Times: “Garcetti will be one of Biden’s highest-profile supporters in California’s March 3 primary, but the endorsement is unlikely to have any practical effect on the highly competitive race. Dianne Feinstein, the state’s senior U.S. senator, is also supporting Biden. And Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, who had endorsed California Sen. Kamala Harris before she dropped out of the presidential race, also announced his support for Biden on Thursday.”\n-- Fun read: Philadelphians looking for love on Tinder may have come across “Daddy Bernie,” a profile set up for Sanders by a local man who just wants to inform people on the dating app about his favorite candidate. From the Philadelphia Inquirer : “Alex Scheinberg, 26, is not a senator from Vermont. Or any other state. He actually doesn’t have a job. And he lives in his childhood home. But, Scheinberg said, that gives him more time to mix politics and pleasure in order to promote his favorite candidate in a forum that’s increasingly becoming a venue for political endorsement and engagement. … Scheinberg has his Tinder profile set to see all genders and sexual orientations, though he is straight. This way, he said, he can maximize the number of people seeing Sanders’ campaign message. That’s the same reason he swipes right on almost everyone, to reach as many people as possible. (For those who don’t have to experience the horror show that is modern online dating, swiping right on a profile means you’re interested. Swiping left, not so much.)”\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\nOne of Vice President Pence’s children got married at the Naval Academy over the holidays: . @SecondLady and @VP ’s daughter @charlipence was married to Henry Bond at the @NavalAcademy on December 28th.

It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

New is not always better. The latest news about the mystery pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, is that scientists may have found a new virus. And this novel virus may cause of over 40 people getting sick and now a 61-year-old man passing away.\nYes, this is the “mystery pneumonia” outbreak that I covered for Forbes last week. Now, as CBS News reported, lead scientist Xu Jianguo has said that it’s been “preliminarily determined” that a new strain of coronavirus may be the culprit. That would preliminarily suck because who wants yet another virus that can potentially kill to worry about in this world.\nThose of you who took Latin in high school so that you can talk to nobody may recognize that “corona” is the Latin word for “crown”. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that have spikes on their surface that make them look like little crowns. READ Strides Pharma up 3% on profitable USFDA inspection of Bangalore unit\nCan you you imagine one of these viruses on a person’s head?\nWell, it’s not as good to have on you as a real crown. That’s because human coronaviruses are those that can infect humans, of which there are now seven types. The most common types are two, 229E and NL63, that fall into the alpha subgroup, and two, OC43 and HKU1, that fall into the beta subgroup. These four may not be that easy to remember because their names sound a bit like droids on Star Wars. But that’s OK, because these four aren’t the most worrisome ones. They tend to cause mild-to-moderate upper respiratory illnesses that consist of cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, cough, headache, sore throat, fever, and general feeling of blech. Occasionally, the infection can involve your lower-respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis or pneumonia, which is more likely to happen when your immune system, heart, or lungs are weakened.\nThe human coronaviruses to worry much more about are the remaining three. One is the SARS-Coronavirus (CoV), which causes, you guessed it, SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome. This was the beta coronavirus that sickened 8,098 people and killed 774 around the world during the 2003 SARS outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the SARS-CoV killed 14% to 15% of those infected. READ What’s at Stake within the Harvard Lawsuit? A long time of Debate Over Race in Admissions\nA second is the MERS-CoV, which causes MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. As the WHO describes, MERS was first found in Saudi Arabia in 2012. This beta coronavirus has also been quite a killer, with around 35% of those infected dying.\nThe third human coronavirus in this uh-oh group and seventh overall is this new coronavirus just found in Wuhan, China. It doesn’t have an official name yet and is listed on the CDC website as “Novel Coronavirus 2019.”\nThis new one is still a quite a mystery. The MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, like other human coronaviruses, can spread from one human to another through contact with respiratory secretions. So far, word is that there haven’t been any clear cases of one human infecting another with “Novel Coronavirus 2019.” But that leaves many unanswered questions such how the heck did so many people get infected if there were no human-to-human transmission? Did everyone somehow interact with the same group of animals?

A new virus in a human can be a bit like a kid in an Apple Store. Once viruses have “broken” into a human, they can explore the human body and eventually learn how to jump from one human to another. After all, viruses can evolve quite quickly.\nStay tuned. For now, many countries in Asia are remaining on alert and screening those traveling from Wuhan. They don’t want to be caught off guard the next time something new emerges about this new virus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T13:32:49.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The illness, which has been traced to the Chinese city of Wuhan, is believed to have originated in or around the seafood markets there, though it’s still unclear exactly how it began.\nThe six new cases that appeared in Hong Kong included several young children who had returned from Wuhan and exhibited fever and other pneumonia-like symptoms. This all sounds pretty rough, but there’s actually some good news in the latest report from the South China Morning Post .\nThe illness is believed to be a new strain of the coronavirus, according to health officials in China. There have been no reports of deaths related to the infections, and it doesn’t appear as though the outbreak is particularly contagious. Nevertheless, Chinese authorities are monitoring relatives of those who came down with the sickness in order to get the jump on new infections if they should arise.\nThe good news is that many of the suspected cases have already been resolved, with over 30 of the nearly 60 cases having been discharged. Early symptoms include trouble breathing and fevers, but conditions improve rapidly after treatment, according to health officials.\nThere have been no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, which is great news. Some of the most serious outbreaks to happen in China, including illnesses like bird flu, were animal-to-human transmissions. This new sickness hasn’t spread particularly fast, and Chinese authorities are working on developing a test to diagnose the virus within hours.\nAt the moment, there’s no reason to panic, even if you’re living in China and happen to be near the area where the infections are popping up. We’ll be keeping our fingers crossed that the source of the infection can be nailed down soon and this whole strange saga can be resolved.\nSign up for BGR's Newsletter .

Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China’s 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.\nThe Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases, and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of yesterday had completed nucleic acid tests. — Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T08:53:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was quoted by the city’s official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n“So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T05:57:52.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The remaining patients are said to be in a stable condition at two have been released from hospital. Sharing headlines More than 730 patients who had contact with the infected have been checked and infection ruled out. The new virus has sparked fears of a much larger outbreak similar to that caused by the SARS virus which started in 2002 and killed over 700 people. Health authorities in city of Wuhan said the man who died had complications including chronic liver disease and abdominal tumours and was a frequent visitor to a food market on the city’s outskirts where the outbreak is believed to have started in December.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Just needs those incentives & trust.”\nAlso this morning, Wuhan health authorities reported the first death from the new disease. The patient was a 61-year old man who frequently visited the live market in Wuhan that most cases have been linked to. He also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and died on Thursday. The Wuhan Health Commission said 41 people so far have been confirmed to have been infected with the new virus; no new patients have been identified since 3 January.\nNews about the sequence came from Edward Holmes, a virologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney in Australia, who tweeted the first notice about the availability of what he referred to as an “initial” sequence of the virus early this morning. Holmes is a member of a consortium led by Yong-Zhen Zhang of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health that posted the sequence on an open-access site , virological.org. The consortium said it had also deposited the sequence in GenBank. In a brief note, the group said researchers were free to analyze and share the data, but asked that groups “communicate with us if you wish to publish results that use these data in a journal.”\nThe analyzing began immediately. Evolutionary biologist Andrew Rambaut at the University of Edinburgh calculated that the virus has a 89% similarity to a SARS-related member of the Sarbecovirus es, a subgenus within the Betacoronavirus genus.\nPotentially really important moment in global public health-must be celebrated. Jeremy Farrar, Wellcome Trust\nKevin Olival, vice-president for research of the EcoHealth Alliance in New York City, published a phylogenetic tree on Twitter and concurred that the new virus “definitely clusters” with the SARS-related coronaviruses. (Later in the day, Rambaut criticized the fact that Olival did not credit the researchers who isolated the virus and sequenced it. “This is one of the reasons why people are reticent to share data,” Rambaut wrote on Twitter . \"No acknowledgement of where the data comes from or who generated it. The [phylogenetic tree] is even branded with a logo.”)\nRalph Baric, a coronavirus researcher at the University of North Carolina, notes that of the four known SARS-related bat viruses capable of infecting humans, this one is the most distant from SARS itself. After downloading the sequence last night, his lab immediately began trying to reverse-engineer a live virus from the sequence, which can be helpful to develop antibody tests and to start experiments in animal models. “If you want to have a strong public health response, you have to do this quickly,” says Baric, who leads one of the few labs in the world that can re-create coronaviruses just from their sequences. (Bureaucratic hurdles would make it difficult for China to ship the actual virus quickly to other countries, he says.)\nBaric hopes this virus’s discovery and the response to it illustrate the speed at which scientists can move by working together. “One of the things that’s sad is that the public doesn’t realize how incredibly competent the public health and the basic science community are at going from a newly discovered virus to a tremendous amount of capacity to trace and try to control its spread,” Baric says.\nWith reporting by Martin Enserink.

Seven are currently in a critical condition.\nA new virus arriving on the scene, leaving patients with pneumonia, is always a worry and health officials around the world are on high alert.\nBut is this a brief here-today-gone-tomorrow outbreak or the first sign of something far more dangerous? What is this virus?\nViral samples have been taken from patients and analysed in the laboratory.\nAnd officials in China and the World Health Organization have concluded the infection is a coronavirus.\nCoronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which is caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002.\n“There is a strong memory of Sars, that’s where a lot of fear comes from, but we’re a lot more prepared to deal with those types of diseases,” says Dr Josie Golding, from the Wellcome Trust. Is it serious?\nCoronaviruses can cause symptoms ranging from a mild cold all the way through to death.\nThis new virus appears to be somewhere in the middle.\n“When we see a new coronavirus, we want to know how severe are the symptoms – this is more than cold-like symptoms and that is a concern but it is not as severe as Sars,” says Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh. Where has it come from?\nNew viruses are detected all the time.\nThey jump from one species, where they went unnoticed, into humans.\n“If we think about outbreaks in the past, if it is a new coronavirus, it will have come from an animal reservoir,” says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham.\nSars jumped from the civet cat into humans.\nAnd Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which has killed 858 out of the 2,494 recorded cases since it emerged in 2012, regularly makes the jump from the dromedary camel. Which animal?\nOnce the animal reservoir where the virus normally camps out is detected, the problem becomes much easier to deal with.\nThe cases have been linked to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, in Wuhan.\nBut while some sea-going mammals can carry coronaviruses (such as the Beluga whale), the market also has live wild animals, including chickens, bats, rabbits, snakes, which are more likely to be the source. Why China?\nProf Woolhouse says it is because of the size and density of the population and close contact with animals harbouring viruses.\n“No-one is surprised the next outbreak is in China or that part of the world,” he says. How easily does it spread?\nPerhaps the single most reassuring fact about this outbreak is that the new virus does not appear to spread from one person to another.\nThis is a major concern with new viruses that infect the lungs, as coughs and sneezes are a highly effective way for a virus to spread.\nIf it was going person-to-person, then you would expect cases in healthcare workers as they come into close contact with sick patients.\nChinese officials say that has not happened.\nHowever, some experts have cautioned it may be too soon to know whether there is human-to-human transmission.\nProf Ball says: “There would have to be 59 animal-to-human transmission events in a short amount of time, intuitively that does seem quite high, it is still an open question.”\nProf Woolhouse says: “I’m cautious rather than sceptical, it is early too tell – most coronaviruses are actually transmissible and that would be my initial concern.” How fast is it spreading?\nSo far, not very.\nAll the 59 patients had symptoms start between 12 December and 29 December 2019.\nAnd there have been no further cases reported.\n“It’s positive that we’ve not seen an expansion in cases,” Dr Golding says.\n“China is taking it seriously and it could be contained, we have to wait and see.”\nConcerns remain, however, that the virus could be spread by the hundreds of millions of people travelling for Chinese New Year later this month. How have Chinese authorities responded?\nInfected people have been treated in isolation to minimise the risk of the bug spreading.\nMore than 150 people who have had contact with infected patients are being monitored for signs of the disease.\nExtra checks such as temperature scans have been put in place to screen travellers.\nAnd the seafood market was closed for cleaning and disinfection. How worried are the experts?\nDr Golding says: “At the moment, until we have more information, it’s really hard to know how worried we should be.\n“Until we have confirmation of the source, that’s always going to make us uneasy.”\nProf Ball says: “We should be worried about any virus that explores humans for the first time, because it’s overcome the first major barrier.\n“Once inside a [human] cell and replicating, it can start to generate mutations that could allow it to spread more efficiently and become more dangerous.\n“You don’t want to give the virus the opportunity.” TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-10T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T09:37:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The outbreak raised the spectre of another Sars epidemic , which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported on Thursday (Jan 9), citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged on Wednesday night after they did not exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word \"corona\", meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever.\nShortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD? Many coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people.\nRelated Story Wuhan pneumonia outbreak may be linked to new type of virus from same family as Sars, Mers: WHO Related Story Eight Chinese patients afflicted by unidentified Wuhan virus released from hospital The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it was possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS? Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past.\nEarlier laboratory tests ruled out Sars and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSars emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes Mers, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?

They are expected to end their two-day trip today. The team will consist of Lam Chong, director of the Disease Control Center of the Health Bureau (SSM), and two officials from the public hospital, the government reported on Sunday. According to a statement issued yesterday by the Government Information Bureau, the team will be informed by national health officials about the appropriate treatment for infected patients, as well as measures to prevent or if necessary control the spread of the identified coronavirus. The SSM’s Public Health Laboratory already has diagnostic tests that can detect if a patient has been infected with the pathogen identified in the Wuhan outbreak. As of Sunday, all patients suspected of having symptoms of pneumonia – and whose preliminary test results exclude the possibility of regular influenza – were subjected to these diagnostic tests. The government additionally received on Sunday a notice from the mainland’s National Health Commission stating that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus associated with the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, had been released through the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data. Since 1 January, local medical institutions have informed the health authority and other relevant government departments about a total of 10 cases, each involving a patient with fever and respiratory problems, and that had been in Wuhan in the previous 14 days. Tests have ruled out the possibility of the Wuhan coronavirus in eight of the patients, while two remain in isolation for further testing. The government is paying close attention to the latest developments regarding the viral pneumonia cases that have occurred in Wuhan and has taken several measures to minimize the risk of such cases having any impact on Macau. The city continues to advance local preparedness regarding response to a potential viral outbreak, including a uniform level of training in relation to the control of infectious disease and procedures of handling suspicious cases for medical professionals. The SSM has also worked to ensure that there is sufficient reserve supply of medication, medical consumables and other equipment. The government stressed again yesterday that there is no cause for alarm regarding the outbreak in Wuhan. Nonetheless, a heightened level of awareness should be displayed by members of the public and greater attention given to the maintenance of personal and environmental hygiene. Macau residents either working, studying or living in Wuhan should remain additionally vigilant, it said.

Public Health Agency says Canadians at low risk from pneumonia in central China by Teresa Wright, The Canadian Press Posted Jan 13, 2020 4:49 pm EST A vendor gives out copies of newspaper with a headlines of \"Wuhan break out a new type of coronavirus, Hong Kong prevent SARS repeat\" at a street in Hong Kong, Saturday, Jan. 11, 2020. The federal Public Health Agency says it believes Canadians are at low risk of contracting a new type of pneumonia that has killed one person and has made dozens sick in central China, but it has issued a warning to travellers to and from the city of Wuhan. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Andy Wong\nOTTAWA — The federal public health agency says it believes Canadians are at low risk of contracting a new type of pneumonia that has killed one person and made dozens sick in central China, but it has issued a warning to travellers to and from the city of Wuhan.\nThe agency is advising travellers to and from the city in China’s central Hubei province to avoid high-risk areas such as farms, live animal markets, areas where animals may be slaughtered or surfaces with animal droppings or secretions.\nCanada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam has also been in close contact with provincial and territorial counterparts to share information about the illness, which has sparked concerns over a possible outbreak similar to the SARS virus, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nThe U.N.’s World Health Organization said Thai officials have reported that a traveller from Wuhan has been hospitalized in Thailand with the virus — the first confirmed case of the virus found outside China, where a total of 41 people are suffering from this new “coronavirus.”\nA 61-year-old man has also died from the illness — China’s first known death from the mysterious new virus.\nThe outbreak has been traced to Wuhan, where it affected several dozen people who had been to a major meat and seafood market.\nCanada’s public health agency says the likelihood of an outbreak in Canada linked to the cases in China is considered low at this time mainly because of the lack of any clear evidence of person-to-person spread. But officials are remaining vigilant.\n“Given we are at the height of respiratory illness season, it is not unexpected that countries, including Canada, may investigate or test travellers with severe pneumonia who are returning from the affected area,” said Anna Maddison, a senior media relations adviser with the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n“This is to be expected given our surveillance systems have been alerted and out of an abundance of caution to rule out the possibility of infection with the novel coronavirus.”\nA statement issued Monday by the WHO said it is working with officials in Thailand and China following the report of the confirmed case outside China. The WHO’s director-general is consulting with the agency’s emergency committee, which generally decides whether viral outbreaks merit an expanded response from health authorities.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown but has sought to play down speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic.\nChinese scientists have undertaken gene sequencing for the newly-identified coronavirus. This allows Canada’s health agency to implement diagnostic tests for this novel virus, Maddison said.\n“PHAC is continuing to collaborate with partners internationally as well as working with federal, provincial and territorial partners and public health authorities and to ensure Canada’s preparedness to rapidly identify and prevent the spread of this emerging disease should it present in Canada.”\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 13, 2020.\n— With files from The Associated Press.\nTeresa Wright, The Canadian Press MORE FROM National ", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-14T04:04:01.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The woman was hospitalised on 8 January.\nAltogether, 41 people have been infected by the disease, which was first reported by Chinese authorities on New Year’s Eve, and has symptoms including fever, breathing difficulties and pneumonia.\nThe first fatality was recorded on Saturday, when a 61-year-old man died from the illness. Seven patients have been discharged and six remain in critical condition, according to the Wuhan municipal health commission.\nMost of the cases were of workers, handlers or frequent visitors to one food market in Wuhan city, but authorities have not yet pinpointed the origin of the disease, raising fears of more cases.\n“It is vital that investigations continue to identify the source of infection,” said a WHO spokesman, Tarik Jašarević.\nThe woman hospitalised in Thailand “reported a history of visiting local markets in Wuhan on a regular basis prior to the onset of illness on 5 January 2020. However, she did not report visiting the Huanan South China Seafood Market,” he said in an emailed statement.\n“This is in line with reporting from China, where they indicated that most – but not all – of the cases were vendors, operators or visitors to the Huanan (seafood) market.\nThe most worrying situation from a public health perspective would be if the disease could be passed between people. Preliminary investigations have found “no clear evidence of human to human transmission,” Jašarević said.\nThere have also not been any infections reported among healthcare workers, who would be among the most vulnerable if the virus can jump directly between people.\nChinese authorities are monitoring 763 people who had close contacts with people who fell ill. So far no related cases have been found.\n“However, the mode(s) of transmission has not yet been determined and human to human transmission is always a concern when patients have respiratory symptoms. This requires further investigation,” Jašarević added.\nChina's Sars-like illness worries health experts Read more\nThere have been no new cases reported by China since 3 January, although the case identified in Thailand raised concerns about the disease spreading.\nThe WHO said in a statement that it was not unexpected, and it had already called for active monitoring and preparation in other countries; China has also shared genetic sequencing for the disease, making it faster to identify cases.\n“WHO is working closely with countries to help them prepare for the rapid detection and response to cases or clusters,” it said, without specifying which countries.\nResidents and observers are particularly wary of an outbreak in China after the Sars outbreak in 2002 and 2003, which spread to at least 37 countries and killed more than 800 people. Initial efforts by officials to cover up the epidemic is believed to have worsened its impact.\nChinese authorities have said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that those who had had contact with patients, including health workers, had not contracted the virus.\nBut ahead of China’s spring festival, when China celebrates lunar new year and millions of people travel across the country to return home, authorities have cautioned residents to be on the lookout for symptoms such as fever, difficulties breathing or body aches.\nCoronaviruses come from the same family of viruses that circulate among animals and have given rise to outbreaks such as Sara and Mers. Authorities believe it is linked to a seafood market in Wuhan that also sells wild animals.\nThe Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said the risk posed by the outbreak depends on “whether and how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness”, and medical and other countermeasures available to contain the virus.", "external_links": ["https://who.int/news-room/detail/13-01-2020-who-statement-on-novel-coronavirus-in-thailand", "https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/13-01-2020-who-statement-on-novel-coronavirus-in-thailand"], "published": "2020-01-14T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-14T09:15:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Tanzania reported 42,060 cancer cases and 132 deaths per 100,000 people. Kenya had the highest rate of cancer cases in the region with 47,887 and 176 deaths per 100,000 people.\nThe head of Kenya’s National Cancer Registry Anne Korir attributed these high numbers to late diagnosis, inadequate treatment options and resources.\nTanzania, which records about 21,000 cancer deaths annually, only has two cancer hospitals.\nProf Kariuki, who also heads research and development at Kemri, said Kenya’s Ministry of Health in partnership with the institute is likely to launch a national surveillance registry that will analyse data collected for more than 10 years to map cancer hotspots in the country.\nSince 2013, Kenya has bought cancer equipment as part of the Managed Equipment Service (MES), which are then installed in high traffic hospitals in the counties.\nAndrew Odhiambo, an oncologist and lecturer at the school of medicine at the University of Nairobi, said that more research was needed to guide clinical and public health decisions in the country.\nThe research would go beyond collection of data to specific treatment.\nStill on research, Francis Makokha, a cancer researcher at the Mount Kenya University, said doctors would no longer refer to research done on African Americans to make clinical decisions.\n“A study on the Nigerian population demonstrated a different mutational pattern from that observed in African Americans, suggesting differences in heredity and environmental factors that increase the risk of cancer and this also showed that cancer risks at a genetic level could be based on region, population or race,” said Dr Makokha.\nHe made reference to “precision medicine,” where patients are treated based on the genetic mutations they possess rather than a generalised treatment as has been the practice.\nMajor outbreaks\nWhile acting as the head of Labs at Africa’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention between 2004 and 2010, Kariuki Njenga and his colleagues responded to disease outbreaks on many occasions.\nFrom haemorrhagic fevers like Ebola and Rift Valley Fever to malaise-inducing Brucellosis. Prof Njenga said he wished there was a way he and his colleagues could intervene by trying some of the diagnostics, vaccines or drugs to treat the outbreak.\nThe WHO reports that 47 (out of 54) African countries (87 per cent) have reported emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases since 1997.This has put scientists in Africa between a rock and a hard place because they are ill prepared.\nEmerging infections are diseases whose spread was previously unknown to researchers and whose incidence were down but are now coming back deadlier and much harder to contain. They include Ebola, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)—H5N1, H5N8 and H7N9—and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\nMost of these diseases are zoonotic, spreading from animals to humans.\nA professor of epidemiology and virology at Washington State University and his team already found that the dromedary camels in North Eastern Kenya were already exposed to MERS-CoV and they would not know when it would spread humans, or what would trigger it.\nAnother researcher from the University of Nairobi Omu Anzala and his colleagues from the University of Helsinki in Finland discovered a sixth Ebola virus species—Bombali ebolavirus—in an Angolan free-tailed bat in the Taita Hills in April 2019.\nThe Ebola outbreak had killed 2,200 people by November in 2019 in the DR Congo. In November 11, 2019, the European Commission granted marketing authorisation to Merck’s vaccine Ervebo to be used on people as the virus swept through the DR Congo.\nCarrying out vaccination in the middle of an outbreak is often challenging, but presents the best opportunity for the researchers to study the pathogen and how it adapts to the environment to cause the disease.\nProf Njenga predicts that East Africa is likely to embrace this bold move during outbreaks. Due to the zoonotic nature of these disease, Prof Anzala, the director of KAVI Institute of Clinical Research at the University of Nairobi predicts increased collaboration between human and veterinary health in tackling these diseases.\nClimate change\nWhile it’s true that the world is becoming warmer, Mark Nanyingi, a research associate at the Faculty of Liverpool, is not worried about the heat as much as how it will change the patterns of the way diseases will spread.\nIn February last year, Olkalau in Kenya’s cold central region experienced an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever. This was an unusual place to report this disease in cattle when compared with the arid Northern parts of Kenya such as Garissa where the disease is common.\nDr Nanyingih, an infectious diseases epidemiologist and researcher from Liverpool University was slow to peg the Rift Valley Fever infections in Olkalau to the rise in temperatures, but he did not rule it out.\nResearch is already showing diseases such as malaria are found in areas that normally would not have been found. While malaria transmission has been associated with the endemic zones, Kenya’s National Malaria Strategy notes that increasing temperatures and changes in the rain patterns associated with climate change are likely to lead to an increase in areas suitable for mosquito breeding and malaria transmission.\nThe United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that countries in the equatorial belt, such as Uganda, Kenya and Cameroon, will experience an increase in temperature by an approximately 1.4° Celsius.\nThis, Dr Nanyingi says, is revising weather patterns making it possible for disease-causing vectors such as mosquitoes to make a home in places that were previously uninhabitable for them.\nAt 20° Celsius, the malaria parasite takes 26 days to develop, while at 25° Celsius it takes 13 days. Moreover, at these optimal temperatures, mosquitoes mature, bite and transmit malaria faster.\nAedes mosquitoes which transmits dengue fever and yellow fever have a wider range, but rarely convey the virus in colder places that fall below 10° Celsius.\nDiversity and inclusion\nIn February 2019, the London School of Economics and Political Science came under criticism for advertising a research in Africa job based at the institution\nMany African researchers questioned why the academic position for a Network for African Health Systems and Policies could not be in Africa where research on health systems was already established.\nKenneth Munge, a health systems expert, took offence at the clamour for the LSE to “identify” a new network when there were many existing ones in Africa.\nThese conversations also came up as universities such as Oxford raised concern over African researchers often being denied visas to meet with their UK counterparts in research collaborations.\nAccording to the Director of Science at Tanzania’s Ifakara Health Institute, Fredros Okumu, in 2020 researchers in Africa will become even more cognisant of the “colonial” biases that have been perpetuated and in some cases “normalised.”\n“I hope that a new normal starts to emerge regarding decision making, resource allocation and accountability and this will require that our scientists take greater control of the agenda,” said Dr Okumu.\nHe encouraged African governments and the private sector to invest in research, so they can be apportioned to their rightful segment of the international “cake” “commensurate to its contribution to the global growth” and produce the proverbial “critical mass of researchers” that the continent needs.\nThe push to decolonise research may have reached the ears of a major funder in Africa, K-based Wellcome Trust.\nIn 2016, the Wellcome Trust handed over two major research programmes to the African Academy of Sciences’ platform, Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa: Deltas Africa, which was then worth $79 million; and H3Africa, a genomics programme established in 2012.\nIn 2017, Deltas funded the first 11 research consortia whose focus was not only research, but also training researchers with affirmative action for increasing women and minorities in research. Deltas has just made its second call for applications from African researchers.eds.\nThomas Kariuki, director of programmes of the African Academy of Sciences, which supports thousands of researchers in Africa, said there was a correlation between the development of a country and its funding for research.\nAccording to Unesco data, Kenya spends 0.8 per cent of its GDP on research, producing 225 researchers per one million people. Tanzania spends 0.5 per cent of its GDP on research with 18 researchers per one million people while Uganda spends 0.2 per cent of its GDP on research with 26 researchers per one million people. Women only account for 30 per cent of researchers in East Africa.\nThis pales in comparison to the developed countries. China spends two per cent of its GDP on research and has 1,096 researchers per one million people. America spends 2.7 per cent of its GDP on research and has 4,217 researchers per one million people.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS.\nA Chinese woman has been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus, Thai authorities said on Monday, the first time the virus has been detected outside China. In all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus. One of the patients has died.\n“From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit.\nThe WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. “It is still early days, we don’t have a clear clinical picture.”\nSome types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others – like the one that causes MERS – are far more severe.

This is from the Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul. The woman is recovering at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi province, about 12 kilometres outside of Bangkok.\n“She is now showing few fever or respiratory symptoms, and if doctors give her a clearance she could be allowed to go home in as little as a few days. She was the first person detected with the virus outside of China and her rapid diagnosis and successful treatment show the efficiency and effectiveness of Thailand’s health services.”\nSixteen people who shared the flight with the woman were also examined, all with negative results, although some exhibited slight flu-like symptoms.\nSince January 3, a total of 12 passengers arriving from from Wuhan in China have showed flu-like symptoms which justified their being quarantined. Eight have so far been treated and discharged\nThe Chinese woman was treated in an isolation ward. Her infection with the coronavirus was confirmed on Sunday. The Public Health Ministry had not found anyone else infected with the virus.\n59 people in China have been confirmed infected with the new strain of the coronavirus, which has been linked to a sudden outbreak of pneumonia in central China that has killed one.

Another 121 people are under medical supervision as doctors try to confirm whether or not they have the same illness.\nThe sickness, which is being compared to bird flu and SARS, appears to have originated in or near the Huanan seafood market, and some of the original infections were traced to workers who operate stalls there. Now, health workers and government officials say that two female patients from Hong Kong are also exhibiting symptoms, and that the pair had visited Wuhan just two weeks prior.\nAs the South China Morning Post reports, health officials still don’t know exactly where this viral pneumonia came from, though they have ruled out multiple possibilities. Despite the fact that additional infections have been confirmed, it’s still believed that the virus doesn’t pass from person to person, as no medical staff or relatives of those who are infected have been diagnosed with the same illness.\nIt’s still possible that the illness is related to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, according to Dr. Gauden Galea of the World Health Organization. “There are many potential causes of this type of illness and further laboratory tests are ongoing to determine the cause of the disease,” Galea said in a statement. “At this point, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak.”\nIt’s important to note that no deaths have been attributed to this new, unknown pneumonia virus and that Chinese officials seem to be doing their best to isolate anyone who might be infected in order to separate them from the general population. Hopefully, this will be enough to put a lid on an increasingly scary situation.\nSign up for BGR's Newsletter .

Picture: AFP\nNews of the sudden outbreak led to online speculation of a link to the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\nAt its height, SARS infected more than 8000 people worldwide, killing 349 in mainland China and a further 299 in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003.\n“A number of health officials in Wuhan said that the cause of the current outbreak is not clear, and it cannot be concluded that it is the SARS virus as rumoured online,” the official newspaper People’s Daily said on its Weibo microblog.\n“Other severe pneumonia is more likely.”\nAuthorities in Hong Kong, which is about four hours from Wuhan by train, have placed the city on high alert, stepping up border screening and ensuring local hospitals are prepared.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said it was monitoring the situation closely.\n“Investigations are still being carried out and authorities cannot yet confirm what pathogen is causing this illness,” WHO senior adviser Paige Snider said in a statement.\n“There are many potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

situation in Wuhan is unusual, and we are not sure about the reasons behind the outbreak yet,” Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee told The South China Morning Post .\n“Since we are now in the holiday season, and Hong Kong has close transport ties with Wuhan, we must stay alert.”\nUniversity of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-young acknowledged similarities between the Wuhan virus, SARS and the deadly 1997 outbreak of bird flu but said there was no need for panic.\n“There are chances that the virus was transmitted from animals to humans, but so far the authorities have not identified the virus,” Prof Yuen told The Post .\nWHO criticised China for under reporting the number of SARS cases following the 2003 outbreak, which originated in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.\nChina sacked its then health minister Zhang Wenkang for the poor handling of the crisis in 2003, several months after the first case was reported.\n– with AFP\n Mystery flu

Investigations are still being carried out by the health authorities in China and they cannot yet confirm what pathogen is causing the illness.\n“There are many potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. WHO is closely monitoring this event and will share more details with us in due course,” said the statement.\nNikkei Asian Review had reported that Asian governments are increasing their precautionary measures to prevent a mass outbreak after Beijing had reported of the 44 cases of a “viral pneumonia of unknown origin”.\nThere are concerns that the flu-like virus is linked to the highly contagious SARS virus that caused hundreds of deaths in Asia and elsewhere 17 years ago.\nThe outbreak prompted authorities in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia to take emergency measures, including stricter health control at borders and temperature screenings on all flights from Wuhan, in China’s central Hubei Province, where the outbreak originated.\nMeanwhile, the Health Ministry said it will continue to monitoring symptoms of influenza-like illnesses and severe acute respiratory infection throughout the country. It will also look into the usage of antivirus in each state.\nStates have been requested to inform the ministry immediately if there are cases with pneumonia symptoms and if any patients have a history of visiting Wuhan recently.\n“We are also monitoring our international entry points to ensure that travellers coming into the country will go through the necessary health screenings. If we detect anyone with a fever, we will examine the person at our quarantine centres.\n“If we suspect the person has a contagious disease, the individual must be referred to the nearest health facility (based on fever screening procedures at international entry points),” said the statement.

The case is detailed below: MERS-Coronavirus preliminary test result Pending Separately, the CHP today reported that the suspected MERS cases pending results yesterday (January 3), upon preliminary testing, tested negative for MERS Coronavirus. \"Travellers to the Middle East should avoid going to farms, barns or markets with camels; avoid contact with sick persons and animals, especially camels, birds or poultry; and avoid unnecessary visits to healthcare facilities. We strongly advise travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to abstain from arranging camel rides and activities involving direct contact with camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV),\" a spokesman for the CHP said. Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS pages of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP's Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the World Health Organization's latest news for more information and health advice.

So far, 59 people have been diagnosed with the viral pneumonia, including seven in critical condition. Several were stallholders at a suburban seafood market that also sold pheasants, snakes, birds, and the organs of rabbits and other animals, per the South China Morning Post . The respiratory illness has apparently spread to Hong Kong—roughly four hours away by high-speed train—where 15 patients are being treated and officials have increased airport screening for fever among passengers. Little else is known, but a Wuhan health commission says the most typical symptoms are shortness of breath, fever, and occasionally lung infection. The commission adds that \"influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases\" are off the list, per LiveScience , and World Health Organization rep says \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak.\" What makes this news? Horrible memories of SARS—severe acute respiratory syndrome—which was transmitted person-to-person and infected over 8,000 people in 26 countries. \"If it were SARS, we are experienced in managing it,\" says a medical professor in China. \"But if it is a new strain, then we should pay attention.\" (Read more illness stories.)", "external_links": ["https://scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3044207/china-shuts-seafood-market-linked-mystery-viral-pneumonia", "https://livescience.com/mysterious-virus-in-china-sars.html", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/mystery-illness-to-strike-chinese-city-is-not-sars-say-authorities-wuhan", "https://www.livescience.com/mysterious-virus-in-china-sars.html", "https://theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/mystery-illness-to-strike-chinese-city-is-not-sars-say-authorities-wuhan", "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3044207/china-shuts-seafood-market-linked-mystery-viral-pneumonia"], "published": "2020-01-05T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-05T22:56:37.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Photo: Winson Wong More In the case of the 20-year-old female student, who is from the mainland and lives on campus, she recently returned from the city in Hubei province, and was sent to Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin on Sunday after complaining of fever and respiratory infection symptoms.\nShe had visited Union Hospital earlier that day but was not kept in care, sparking questions over whether the private hospital had reported her case to authorities. A hospital spokeswoman said staff explained to the student that she should be quarantined at a public hospital after seeing a doctor, but the woman said she would seek medical consultation elsewhere on her own accord.\nSources said the student lived on the fifth floor at Bethlehem Hall, a dormitory at United College under Chinese University. The institution confirmed she was eventually sent to hospital for further check-ups on Sunday night and was in a stable condition on Monday.\nWuhan pneumonia not Sars, but virus unidentified as more hospitalised Local health authorities said between Sunday and noon on Monday, six more patients who had visited Wuhan in the past two weeks developed pneumonia-related symptoms, including the female student. That brings the total number of suspected cases reported in Hong Kong to 21, of which seven have already been cleared and discharged from hospital.\nThe Centre for Health Protection said the CUHK student was found to have common viruses, including a type of coronavirus unrelated to the cases in Wuhan, while the other five new cases were found to be flu infections or that of known viruses as of Monday.\nAt Bethlehem Hall, which houses 228 students, dormitory staff covered part of their faces on Monday and distributed surgical masks to residents.\nYear Three student Tristia Wong, 20, who lives on the same floor as the female student with symptoms, said their warden had reminded them not to “stay too long” on that floor, adding staff had already cleaned the entire level with bleach.\n“I’ve also moved to sleep in a girlfriend’s room on another floor for the moment. Unless it is really necessary, I won’t go back to the fifth floor,” she said.\nOn Monday night, the student union of Lee Woo Sing College, under CUHK, said in a statement that two hostel residents – who are roommates and had gone to Wuhan last month – were sent to a hospital from the dormitory after one of them was coughing but had no fever.\nA university spokesman confirmed the incident and said the two students had been discharged after undergoing a check-up at a public hospital.\nAt S.H. Ho College, also under CUHK, at least one student who arrived in Hong Kong from Wuhan chose to move into a single room temporarily for isolation, the spokesman added.\nAt University MTR station, which reopened in December after closing for more than a month following vandalism by anti-government protesters, security guards were standing by on Monday, checking staff and students’ IDs before they entered the campus.\nStory continues Much of the 137-hectare campus have been restored but school buses are still operating on temporary routes after most of its 75-vehicle fleet suffered severe damage.\nA large proportion of students and staff were seen wearing masks as studies resumed for the second term of the academic year. Photo: Winson Wong More Students and staff said they found the tightened security acceptable, as the process only took a few seconds.\nAdministrative worker Jay Ling, 29, said staff who were responsible for student programmes faced pressure after the previous term ended early.\n“Rescheduling might be needed to catch up,” she said. “But since my work is mainly about office administration, personally I don’t find any major impact.”\nIn a letter to staff and students, Chinese University vice-chancellor and president Rocky Tuan Sung-chi admitted that some inconveniences were expected for the opening period of the second term.\n“I must ask for your patience and understanding in allowing time for the campus to ease back to its former state of diversity and vibrancy,” he said, adding that greater challenges ahead included rebuilding confidence among university members and stakeholders.\nOn a brighter note, the university has also installed a capsule machine on campus with some 300 small gifts daily to welcome returning students. The feature will be there until Friday.\nThe university, which suffered some of the worst damage during the protests with buildings vandalised and dangerous materials stolen from laboratories, is making repairs worth HK$70 million (US$9 million), including HK$30 million to fix or replace school buses.\nThis article After Hong Kong protest devastation, Chinese University returns for new term under shadow of Wuhan pneumonia first appeared on South China Morning Post\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app .

Health experts warned the public on Monday not to drop their guard over the unidentified outbreak of viral pneumonia in central China, even though the health authorities have ruled out highly contagious viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) or bird flu. On Monday the local health authorities in Wuhan said that work to identify the virus, which has so far infected 59 people in the city, was continuing, but that Sars, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and certain types of flu had been ruled out. Hong Kong health authorities said that the number of suspected cases in the city had reached 21, with six more being reported between Sunday and noon on Monday. All those affected had visited the Hubei capital and developed pneumonia-related symptoms, including a two-year-old boy and a female Chinese University student. The Centre for Health Protection said that the student was found to have common viruses unrelated to the Wuhan cases, including a type of coronavirus, while the other five new cases were found to have flu or other kinds of known viruses. Seven people have already been discharged from hospital. \\n So far, test results show that none of the cases reported outside mainland China – including one recent case in Singapore – were related to the Wuhan virus. While the laboratory results have dispelled fears of a return of the deadly Sars epidemic in 2003 that killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong, the unconfirmed source and unidentified strain of a possible new form of pneumonia has caused alarm among health experts. “There is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown [cause],” the World Health Organisation’s China office said on Sunday. World Health Organisation ‘closely monitoring’ China’s viral pneumonia outbreak “The reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate a link to exposure to animals.” The WHO added that it would continue to monitor the situation closely. The first cases of the mysterious virus were reported last week and many of those affected worked at Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market, which has since been closed. However, the number of those in a “severe condition” has now fallen from 11 to seven. A total of 163 people who had been in close contact with the infected patients have been placed under medical observation. No deaths have been reported. “Preliminary investigations have not shown evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. But the work to identify the virus is still ongoing, as we are still uncertain of the source and cause of the virus,” said Li Gang, director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the local newspaper Changjiang Ribao . Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a specialist in respiratory medicine at Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that based on the available information available, the virus was likely to be a type of coronavirus. China says Wuhan pneumonia is not Sars This virus family includes the common cold and Sars, and the virus is likely to be contagious among human, he said. “It is common that these new types of coronavirus are contagious from person to person. The difference is whether or not it is highly contagious,” Hui said, adding that the virus was clearly a new strain of pneumonia, since all typical diagnostic tests that have been carried out have been negative. Hui said one common method to find out whether a virus was contagious among humans was to determine whether relatives of those infected had fallen ill despite not visiting the market at the centre of the outbreak themselves. Another indication would be whether the medical personnel who have been in contact with patients have been infected. If so, tests would then be performed to see whether the virus genomes show an exact match, which would in turn reveal whether the virus is contagious. However, Hui said it was a positive sign that the number of severe cases had fallen to seven. “This at least shows that some people are able to recover from it,” he said. Ho Pak-leung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, urged the mainland Chinese authorities to release more information – including the age, gender, suspected infected area and condition – of the patients in Wuhan. China pneumonia outbreak raises spectre of Sars “There is now more information from the mainland that shows that the virus could have first been transmitted from animals to humans,” Ho said. “Although now the virus [has been confirmed not to be] Sars and Mers, [coronavirus] carried in animals has been identified as a common cause of pneumonia in humans in recent years,” Ho told Commercial Radio, noting that most cases identified have been linked to the wet market in Wuhan. Ho added that in the previous Sars and Mers epidemics, around 20 per cent of those infected had passed the virus on to other humans. Sars claimed the lives of 299 people in Hong Kong and 349 in mainland China in 2002 and 2003. Scientists later concluded that the virus originated from bats, and later passed through civets before reaching humans.

Locally, the CHP's surveillance with public and private hospitals, with practising doctors and at boundary control points is firmly in place. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East and developed relevant symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be taken to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS-CoV. Travellers to affected areas should maintain vigilance, adopt appropriate health precautions and take heed of personal, food and environmental hygiene. The public may visit the MERS pages of the CHP and its Travel Health Service , MERS statistics in affected areas , the CHP's Facebook Page and YouTube Channel , and the World Health Organization's latest news for more information and health advice.

He added that there are several potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than Sars.\nMunicipal health officials in Wuhan said they had ruled out common respiratory diseases, such as influenza, bird flu and adenovirus infection, as the cause.\nEleven of those infected were in critical condition and the rest stable, they said, adding that all had been isolated and doctors were observing 121 people with whom they had been in close contact.\nClean-up efforts at a seafood market where some victims were vendors have been completed, the city officials said.

Over those seasons, 14,038 patients were admitted to a hospital with lab-confirmed flu.\nThe primary analysis, which included 9,298 cases and 6,451 controls (those without lab-confirmed flu) found that overall vaccine protection against mortality was 31%, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 3% to 51%. The authors found no evidence, however, that the flu vaccine reduced the severity of influenza illness. They report that 84% of the patients in the study were at increased risk of severe outcomes.\nThe authors conclude, \"This study reinforces the public health benefit of the influenza immunisation program in protecting against mortality, as well as reducing the risk of hospitalization.\" They say the findings are similar to the results of a 2015 longitudinal study involving elderly patients in France.

The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.\n Hi-tech scanners being installed at Lanka's Ruwanweliseya News At least two Bhutanese people are diagnosed with TB every day News Bhutan looks to technology to control dog population News Marine export earnings increase by 34 million dollars Tech , News , World Huawei braces itself to withstand another year of strong headwinds News OPINION: Tomorrow’s Innovators Most Read Myanmar sends 172 Bengalis caught in its sea territory to Sittwe Suu Kyi warns ethnic armed groups not to take advantage but solve internal strife Ways must be found for all parties to participate in the peace process: General Yawd Serk UNDP plans to introduce its work schedule in Jan Mon State has over 1,753,000 eligible voters for 2020 election Local fuel prices go up by Ks20-30 compared to December 13 Yangon Airport takes monitoring measures to prevent Wuhan pneumonia Deputy military chief admits some need for constitution amendment Most Recent Myanmar sends 172 Bengalis caught in its sea territory to Sittwe 7 hours ago Suu Kyi warns ethnic armed groups not to take advantage but solve internal strif... 7 hours ago Ways must be found for all parties to participate in the peace process: General... 7 hours ago UNDP plans to introduce its work schedule in Jan 7 hours ago Mon State has over 1,753,000 eligible voters for 2020 election 7 hours ago Local fuel prices go up by Ks20-30 compared to December 13 7 hours ago Yangon Airport takes monitoring measures to prevent Wuhan pneumonia 8 hours ago Deputy military chief admits some need for constitution amendment 8 hours ago", "external_links": ["http://news-eleven.com", "http://news-eleven.com/", "https://www.news-eleven.com/faq/eleven-application-faqs", "http://eleven.pressreader.com/", "https://straitstimes.com/opinion/lessons-from-sars-will-help-singapore-tackle-bug-from-china", "https://www.instagram.com/elevenmediagroup", "http://youtube.com/watch?v=featured", "https://www.instagram.com/elevenmediagroup/", "https://www.gamma.cachefly.net/js/m_adnetwork.js", "https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/lessons-from-sars-will-help-singapore-tackle-bug-from-china", "https://facebook.com/ElevenMediaGroup", "http://www.news-eleven.com/", "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-pneumonia-outbreak-china-says-no-human-to-human-transmission-as-it-hunts-for", "https://twitter.com/ElevenMyanmar", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=featured", "http://www.youtube.com/watch", "https://gamma.cachefly.net/js/m_adnetwork.js", "https://instagram.com/elevenmediagroup/", "https://news-eleven.com/sites/news-eleven.com/files/apk-file/elevenmedia.apk", "https://news-eleven.com/faq/eleven-application-faqs", "http://www.eleven.pressreader.com/", "https://www.twitter.com/ElevenMyanmar", "https://straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-pneumonia-outbreak-china-says-no-human-to-human-transmission-as-it-hunts-for", "https://www.news-eleven.com/sites/news-eleven.com/files/apk-file/elevenmedia.apk", "http://eleven.pressreader.com", "https://www.facebook.com/ElevenMediaGroup"], "published": "2020-01-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T20:32:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently travelled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised US travellers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\nAustralian Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T10:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T19:12:49.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, Chinese state-run China Central Television (CCTV) said.\nWang Yuedan, an immunology professor at Peking University told Hong Kong media RTHK that coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, warning that the illness may have already spread to other regions of China.\nNo other local Chinese authority has reported a case of the mysterious pneumonia, while the national disease center has kept mum.\nChina has ruled out the flu, bird flu, adenovirus, SARS, and MERS as being the cause of the virus. It added that it is still investigating the matter. Wuhan Update\nOn Jan. 8, China Central Television (CCTV) reported that eight patients were released from Jinyintan Hospital, where all patients infected with the disease were in isolation.\nAccording to the report, these eight patients no longer showed symptoms in the past several days, so doctors made the decision that they could go back home.\nMeanwhile, Chinese netizen and Wuhan resident Wen Xiaoyao posted on Weibo—a Chinese Twitter-like social media platform—that two of her family members were infected with the diseases, one in critical condition.\n“In the beginning, the symptoms were the same as catching a cold. Then they had a fever, which is a symptom of pneumonia. Now one is suffering from organ failure,” Wen posted on Jan. 5.\nSoon after Wen lamented that one of her family members was facing death, her account was removed from Weibo.\nHong Kong media Apple Daily reported on Jan. 5 that the security at Jinyintan Hospital drove away its journalist from the hospital premises that day. All the doctors and nurses in the hospital whom this journalist met were wearing protective gear, such as a face mask, goggles and a body suit.\nThe journalist also witnessed new patients being admitted in the hospital that afternoon.\nThe hospital has two buildings. The journalist observed that patients infected with the virus were isolated in both buildings.\n“Patients being treated in the north building are in severe condition. When their health improves, they will be moved to the south building,” the report said. Out of Mainland China\nOn Jan. 8, Hong Kong Hospital Authority stated that Hong Kong public hospitals had received eight more patients in the past 24 hours who visited Wuhan in the past 14 days and had pneumonia symptoms. The total suspected patients in Hong Kong reached 38.\nThe government agency said new suspected patients—one man and seven women—were being treated at six different hospitals, and that their conditions were stable. The youngest is three years old, and the oldest is 61.\nTaiwan authorities found two new suspected patients on Jan. 8. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control stated that one patient was infected with the H3N2 virus, and still was isolated at home. The other patient came back from Wuhan on Dec. 21, and was isolated at a hospital.\nSouth Korea reported its first suspected case , which is a 36-year-old Chinese citizen who works near Seoul. The patient visited China twice and she was in Wuhan from Dec. 13-17. She was diagnosed with pneumonia on Jan. 8.\nTo protect its people, the Hong Kong government released new rules on Jan. 7, similar to the measures that Taiwan released earlier, which granted health officials the right to isolate suspected patients.\nThe Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service also announced on Jan. 7 that anyone who has traveled to Wuhan should not donate their blood in the first 14 days after returning to Hong Kong.\nThe U.S. Embassy & Consulates in China also published an alert on Jan. 7 that notifies all travelers to protect themselves if they plan to visit Wuhan. China\nChinese media has focused on Wuhan since the outbreak. On Jan. 6, the city’s Communist Party secretary—the top leader of the town—Ma Guoqiang resigned from his position as director of Wuhan’s People’s Congress, China’s rubber stamp legislature.\nThe People’s Congress said Ma resigned due to “the needs of his work,” but didn’t further elaborate on the meaning.\nIn the local government’s history, all former Party secretaries also held the position of director of the local rubber stamp legislature.\nOne of the most efficient ways to protect oneself from the spread of the disease is to wear a face mask, especially the surgical type.\nIn October 2019, a Chinese shipping company leaked to the media a notice from the Chinese regime, banning e-commerce platforms from selling face masks to Hong Kong due to ongoing protests.

Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently travelled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travellers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T05:25:18.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nLaboratory experts as of Wednesday evening had found the novel coronavirus in 15 of the 59 cases, CCTV said, adding that more research must be done before a conclusion is reached.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients operated businesses. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. That outbreak started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T15:39:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word 'corona,' meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it's possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past.

Unlike Sars, it does not appear to spread easily between humans and unlike Mers, which has a mortality rate of about 35%, nobody has died.\nExperts warn world ‘grossly unprepared’ for future pandemics Read more\nBut the identification in preliminary laboratory tests by the Chinese of a novel coronavirus emerging once more from animals to infect humans is worrying for global health experts. When Sars appeared in China in 2002, it was not swiftly identified and contained. It spread around the world – particularly to Canada – via travellers.\nJeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome and an expert in tropical diseases, said: “Epidemics of diseases known and unknown are one of our greatest global health threats – threats that are with us constantly.\n“A cluster of patients with an unusual respiratory infection is, and should always be, a worry. The level of concern raises again when the illness is linked to an animal food source. This is how new viruses jump across the species barrier – as was the case with Sars, Mers, avian flu and Ebola .”\nThe source of the virus is not yet known but investigations have centred on a market in Wuhan selling live animals and seafood. The origin of Sars was eventually traced to bats in a cave in Yunnan province in China. Dromedary camels are the source of Mers, although it is thought they may also have originally been infected by bats.\nThe World Health Organization said in a statement that the Chinese authorities believed the disease “does not transmit readily between people”, but that it could cause severe illness in some patients. Seven people were known to be critically ill at the weekend. The Chinese authorities have not updated the figures since Sunday. State television said eight people taken to hospital with respiratory problems had been sent home.\n“More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and the countermeasures implemented,” the WHO said.\nThe memory of Sars has already triggered precautionary behaviour in Hong Kong, where people arriving from Wuhan are being screened for the flu-like symptoms of respiratory disease. Some people have been hospitalised, but none has proved to have viral pneumonia of the type found in China.\nFarrar said one of the key concerns was whether the infection was passing from one person to another. “Are doctors and nurses treating patients, or family members, who have not had the same exposure to the source, also getting sick?” he asked.\n“If the infection is not passing person to person, then the level of concern is somewhat reduced – although it can always happen later and infections can change.”\nIt appeared that there had not been any newly confirmed cases in Wuhan for about a fortnight, he said, which was reassuring.\n“The health authorities in China are right, therefore, to take the time necessary to carry out thorough tests and to ensure correct diagnosis. When public health responses are rushed, problems follow – as we saw with early responses to the Nipah outbreak in 1999,” he said.\n“While early identification of this new virus is testimony to vastly improved monitoring, the global health community still has much to do to address global epidemic preparedness. We are still without a vaccine or treatment for Sars or Mers, which we have long known to be epidemic threats.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T21:26:09.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

AP | January 09, 2020, 11:35 IST BEIJING: A preliminary investigation into viral pneumonia illnesses sickening dozens of people in and around China has identified the possible cause as a new type of coronavirus , state media said Thursday.Chinese health authorities did not immediately confirm the report from state broadcaster CCTV.Coronaviruses are spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person. Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases , such as SARS and MERS . Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness. The novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.As of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.Eight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.Laboratory experts as of Wednesday evening had found the novel coronavirus in 15 of the 59 cases, CCTV said, adding that more research must be done before a conclusion is reached. Possible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.Since the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday. No serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan. None of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients operated businesses. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.A Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.The new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.Another coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. That outbreak started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.The CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.

Some of the virus types cause less severe disease, while some - like the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - are far more severe.\n\"The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan...pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster,\" the WHO said in a statement.\nIt added that since Chinese authorities have conducted laboratory tests and eliminated the SARS coronavirus and the MERS one as possible causes, as well as flu, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens, \"therefore, a novel coronavirus could not be ruled out\".\nThe pneumonia outbreak started last month, and 59 cases had been reported by Chinese authorities by Sunday.\nThe WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically - including in 2002 to cause SARS and in 2012 to cause MERS.\nIt said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person.\n\"More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection, and the countermeasures implemented,\" the WHO said.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic.

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nLaboratory experts as of Wednesday evening had found the novel coronavirus in 15 of the 59 cases, CCTV said, adding that more research must be done before a conclusion is reached.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients operated businesses. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan’s health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. That outbreak started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\n___\nStobbe reported from New York.

Symptoms can range from fever and coughing to kidney failure, and in some cases lead to death.\nSARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia and spread to 37 countries in 2002 and 2003. A coronavirus is also the culprit for deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS has since killed 851 people globally, according to the WHO.\nBut the new coronavirus in Wuhan appears to not be as lethal as SARS. Its symptoms are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing. Eight patients had recovered and been discharged from hospital as of Wednesday, and no deaths have been reported, according to CCTV.\nThe virus was first detected in Wuhan on December 12. Since then, a total of 59 people have been struck by the illness, with seven patients in critical condition at some stage, Chinese health authorities said on Sunday.\nAuthorities said there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission, and no healthcare workers have been infected.\nSome of the patients were employed at a seafood market in Wuhan. Local media reported the market also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes -- sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals.\nAccording to the WHO, coronaviruses can infect both humans and animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic began. And dromedary camels are considered a likely source of MERS.\nAcross Asia, governments have stepped up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and notification requirements in the wake of the Wuhan outbreak.\nOn Wednesday, South Korea reported a suspected case linked to the Wuhan pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient, a Chinese woman who had visited Wuhan in December, has been isolated and is undergoing treatment and further tests.\nIn Hong Kong, 38 people have been found with fever or respiratory symptoms after traveling from Wuhan, according to the city's Hospital Authority. Among them, 21 have been discharged and so far none has been linked to the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan.\nIn Singapore, travelers arriving from Wuhan are also required to go through temperature screening, according to the Ministry of Health. Doctors have been alerted to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who recently returned from there.

The market hall was then closed until further notice and has been disinfected.\nBy February 5, 2020, 59 patients had been identified. Seven of them are in a critical condition, according to a report by the Robert Koch Institute; no deaths were reported.\nIn addition, South Korea reported that its first suspected case involved a 36-year-old Chinese woman who visited Wuhan last month, according to authorities. She is being treated in a hospital in Bundang, south of Seoul.\nChina&apos;s mysterious outbreak could be new virus, WHO says\nThe good news\nEight patients are currently considered cured and have reportedly left the hospital.\nHaving identified the virus, experts are one step further in their search for what is triggering the mysterious lung disease.\nThe pathogen&apos;s gene sequence has been deciphered, according to the head of the team of Chinese experts, Xu Jianguo.\nHe said the cause is a new type of coronavirus found in the blood and saliva of 15 patients. An investigation into what brought about the outbreak will continue.\nGauden Galea, a WHO representative in China, also confirmed the discovery of the new strain of the coronavirus in a statement.\nAccording to the WHO, the quick preliminary identification of the novel virus is a notable achievement and demonstrates China&apos;s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.\nWhat are coronaviruses?\nCoronaviruses were first found in humans in the 1960s. The name is derived from their appearance under the microscope: The peplomers, the outwardly protruding protein structures of the virus envelope, are arranged in the form of a crown (from Latin: corona).\nCoronaviruses are common and infections are often harmless with patients developing only flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal complaints, especially diarrhea, can also occur. The incubation time for a coronavirus can vary from a few days to two weeks.\nHowever, coronaviruses are also dangerous and can mutate. They are RNA viruses and have high genetic variability, meaning they can easily overcome barriers between different species. Often, an outbreak among humans originates with other mammals, rodents or birds.\nAs a consequence, the infections also can take more severe paths, causing respiratory distress and pneumonia, which can even lead to death.\nIn 2002 and 2003, for example, the aggressive coronavirus SARS-CoV triggered an epidemic. At that time, more than 8,000 people in 29 countries became ill and 774 people died of SARS-CoV. In 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered and spread across the Arabian Peninsula.\nIn both cases, experts suspect animals were the source. The first infections were typical zoonoses - cases where pathogens manage to jump from an animal host to a human host.\nHow is the virus transmitted?\nZoonoses can be transmitted through direct contact between animals and humans as well as - like with many germs - simply through the air, such as by coughing or sneezing.\nBut there are many other ways of infection, for example through food or vectors. A mosquito, tick or other insect can transport a pathogen from the host to another organism without becoming ill itself.\nIn addition, zoonoses can also be transmitted via food, for example when eating meat or animal products. If these are not sufficiently heated or if they were prepared under unhygienic conditions, they also represent a source of infection.\nLunar New Year: Be safe\nCompared to the major instances of SARS and MERS, the current coronavirus outbreak is small, but experts said it should not be underestimated.\nChina is, therefore, exercising caution regarding the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations in late January. Millions of people travel in buses, trains and airplanes to celebrate the holiday.\nWang Yang, the Chinese Transport Ministry&apos;s chief engineer, said authorities will step up efforts to prevent the pneumonia outbreak from spreading further during the holiday period, including ensuring proper disinfection in major public transportation hubs like airport and train stations.\nOther Asian countries also stepped up precautions on entry, especially for travelers from Wuhan, and introduced fever controls to prevent the feared spread of the virus. To date, there are 16 suspected cases in Hong Kong, and a possible patient has been reported in Singapore. Not in all of the cases have a direct connection to Wuhan.\nHow to protect yourself?\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement warning travelers to Wuhan to avoid animal markets and contact with animals or uncooked meat. People in the area should also avoid the sick and wash their hands frequently with soap and water.\nThose who have been to Wuhan and feel ill should seek medical help immediately and avoid contact with others, the report said.\nBefore the doctor is consulted, the practice or clinic should be informed about the travel history and symptoms.\nThe WHO did not issue a specific travel warning.\n DW (English)", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T03:20:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

We have struck a balance,\" Chan said.\nShe did not reply to questions if Wuhan had directly informed Hong Kong about the outbreak.\nChan said the new law can prevent the disease from spreading within Hong Kong and allow the government to ban suspected cases and their contacts leaving the city.\nWuhan health authorities announced the cases on December 31- days after the first case on December 12. The number of people being treated in hospital rose from 26 to 59 in just a few days.\nBut Wuhan shut down a seafood market where wild animals also were being sold where the novel virus originated, raising the specter of SARS.\nChinese authorities have yet to identify the virus, after excluding the deadly SARS, its sister MERS, and bird flu.\nThe Hospital Authority yesterday announced nine more suspected cases of patients who had been to Wuhan city in the past two weeks and fallen sick, taking the total to 30. Seventeen remain in hospitals, with the rest discharged.\nThe nine new cases included three girls aged six, 10 and 16, three boys aged eight and 14, and three adults aged 32 to 49.\nFour have been cleared of the mysterious infection as they had been diagnosed with seasonal flu and human rhinovirus. Laboratory results for the five others are pending.\nBut controller Wong said yesterday there was no need to trace and do surveillance on the contacts of 30 suspected cases as \"there is no case of the Wuhan pneumonia in Hong Kong. I don't think we need to isolate contacts.\"\nThe new law will require doctors to report to the Department of Health any patients who had been to Wuhan in the past two weeks and suffer from a fever and severe respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms.\nAccording to a paper submitted to the Legislative Council on the law amendment, the department said: \"If 'severe respiratory disease associated with novel infectious agent' turns out to be a very serious disease with efficient human-to-human transmission like SARS, it would be disastrous to Hong Kong if there were any delay in implementing preventive and control measures.\"\nChung Kin-lai, director for quality and safety of the Hospital Authority, said there are 480 isolation beds at public hospitals at the moment. If necessary, the authority can boost the number to 1,400 in 72 hours.\nChan said new additional measures to check temperatures of travelers arriving from Wuhan have been introduced at the airport and the express rail station in West Kowloon.\n\"Additional hand-held temperature checking machines have been launched at the West Kowloon station to check all passengers arriving on the two daily trains that pass through Wuhan,\" she said.\nSpeaking before the Executive Council meeting yesterday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said a similar approach was adopted for the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also caused by a novel coronavirus and linked to dromedaries.\nHowever, Civic Party lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki, who is also a doctor, said enforcement of the new law will be difficult as the virus has yet to be identified.\n\"There is not yet a clear standard to determine how long patients should be put under quarantine for,\" he said. \"Even the family and co-workers of the patients may need to be isolated.\"\nHenry Yeung Chiu-fat, president of the Hong Kong Doctors Union, said it may not be practical to ask private doctors to isolate suspected cases before they are sent to public hospitals.\nBut microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong said it is necessary to isolate patients at an early stage when a new infectious disease emerges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-07T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-08T01:24:28.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

About | Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n“There’s always been a threat from coronaviruses,” he told The Telegraph. “These are viruses that are very widespread in lots of different animals and have shown the ability in the past to jump from animals into humans.”\n“It seems like this [new] virus is jumping into humans but not spreading on. But the worry is that if you have a new virus that is exploring a human host it’s possible that they might mutate and spread more easily in humans.”\nO ther experts have added that it is too early to tell how dangerous China’s novel coronavirus is.\n“The biggest thing to ascertain is how transmissible the virus is between humans,” said Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. “This will affect how easily the virus can be contained.”\nLaboratory tests on samples from patients found 15 positive results of a new type of coronavirus, which was isolated from one patient's samples, said Dr Xu.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect both animals and people. Six human coronaviruses species have so far been identified.\nSARS and MERS have proved the most serious to date, both causing widespread outbreaks and deaths. About | Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\nS ARS first emerged in China in 2002, although it was initially covered up by authorities, and spread to 37 countries, infecting 8,000 people and killing 774.\nMERS emerged in the Middle East in 2012 and has infected around 2,500 people and led to 850 deaths.\nAs of January 5, a total of 59 cases of the unexplained pneumonia had been reported in Wuhan, a city with a population of roughly 11 million and the capital of Hubei province.\nAccording to Chinese state media eight people have now been discharged from hospital. The Wuhan health commission said the infection broke out between December 12 and 29, with some of the patients employed at a city seafood market since closed for disinfection.\nT he World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the Chinese findings and said that the identification of a novel virus in a short period of time was a “notable achievement”. Global Health Bulletin REFERRAL article\n“According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people,” said Dr Gauden Galea, WHO representative to China.\nH e added that the WHO does not recommend any travel or travel or trade restrictions on China based on currently available information. But Hong Kong and Singapore are among the neighbouring territories which have introduced disease surveillance measures for travellers arriving from Wuhan.\nThe picture remains far from complete and Dr Xu said that further research will be conducted to better understand the new coronavirus.

Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word \"corona,\" meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it's possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome , also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu , adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n\"Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,\" Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.

The latest incarnation of the Boeing 737 was grounded last year after two fatal crashes which exposed weaknesses in the design development process and software systems.\n400 of the planes, recently manufactured, remain gathering dust, unable to be delivered to their worldwide customers. Another 500, flying for airlines before the grounding, also remain on the ground. The documents were sent yesterday to the House and Senate committees that are probing Boeing’s design of the plane. Boeing’s release of the damaging documents also includes an apology, pertaining to the content of the documents.\n“These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable,”\n“We regret the content of these communications, and apologise to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Congress, our airline customers, and to the flying public for them.”\nMany pages of the documents relate to the development and qualification of 737 Max jet simulators during 2017 and 2018.\n“These communications contain provocative language, and, in certain instances, raise questions about Boeing’s interactions with the FAA in connection with the simulator qualification process.”\nProblems with the Boeing 737 Max resulted in two fatal crashes and the loss of 346 lives. One crash was in Jakarta, Indonesia and the other in Ethiopia. The model has been grounded since March 2019 and has cost the company billions of dollars, a loss of consumer trust, lost the Boeing CEO his job and cast doubt about the future of the 737 Max model.\nThe ‘mea culpa’ that was released by the company with the 100 or so pages of documents seems to reflect a more open stance with regulators, investigators and the FAA. A new CEO takes over the reigns of the beleaguered company today.\n“We welcome, and will fully support, any additional review the FAA believes is appropriate in connection with any of these matters, as well as the continued involvement of the relevant congressional committees with these issues.”\nDelays for any re-regulation of the 737 Max model, allowing it into commercial operation again, will now likely extend into at least the middle of this year, maybe longer. And there is even open speculation by aviation analysts if the model may be fatally flawed and may never fly again.\nThe latest version of the Boeing 737, the ‘Max’ is the fourth re-jig of a 1960’s single-aisle passenger jet that has been the workhouse for short to medium travel around the world for half a century. Boeing was forced into swift re-development its ageing 737 model after the success of the new Airbus 320neo model which was launched in 2014.\nThe re-jig allowed for the use of newer, lighter and more powerful turbo fan-jets (which would provide better performance and lower fuel costs). But the larger engines required mounting the jets further forward on the wings, upsetting the planes’ balance, and necessitating a software fix to control a possible nose-up tendency of the new model. It’s the over-reaction of the MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) software, developed to help control the plane’s pitch, that is thought to have been behind the two crashes.\nThe 737 Max model can be identified with its larger engines and twin winglets at the end of the wings.

Screening continues on Thai-bound flights.\nPublished The Thaiger PHOTO: Screening continues at airports in Thailand receiving passengers from Wuhan in China\nThe mysterious pneumonia-like disease striking dozens of people in Wuhan, China, has now been identified as from the same family of viruses as the deadly SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). This news from Chinese scientists today.\nEarlier today The Thaiger reported that three Thais and a Chinese citizen had been detected arriving from Wuhan in the Hubei province with suspected viral symptoms comparable with a flu or viral pneumonia.\nThe scientists say they’ve found a new “coronavirus in 15 of 57 patients with the illness in the central city of Wuhan, saying it has been preliminarily identified as the pathogen for the outbreak”.\nThe news was reported on the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.\n“Coronaviruses” are a large family of viruses that can cause anything from the common cold (rhino virus) up to to SARS*. According to the WHO, some coronaviruses are able to transmit easily from person to person, while others can not.\nThe CCTV report went on to explain that the current ‘Wuhan Virus’, a coronavirus, appears to not be as lethal as SARS.\n“Its symptoms are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing. Eight patients had recovered and been discharged from hospital as of Wednesday, and no deaths have been reported.” (Translated from CCTV)\nThis new viral outbreak was first detected in the city of Wuhan on December 12 last year. A total of 59 people have been identified as contracting the illness. Seven patients have been in a critical condition at some stage, according to Chinese health authorities. Authorities report that no healthcare workers have been infected.\nSome of the patients were reported to have been employed at a seafood market in Wuhan. Local media reported the market also sold “other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes”. These reports sparked concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals.\nSix coronaviruses are known to infect humans — four of them typically cause the common cold, and the other two are SARS and MERS (the middle east respiratory syndrome, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).\nSARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia and spread to 37 countries in 2002 and 2003.\nIn a statement today the World Health Organisation said that China’s preliminary identification of a “novel virus” in such a short period since its earliest identification, “demonstrates the country’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks”.\nAcross Asia governments are now stepping up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and requirements for notification in the wake of what is being referred to as the “Wuhan outbreak”.\nAirports of Thailand says they are monitoring a the detection of any viral symptoms from Wuhan flights coming out of China. They say that six airports are now ready to cope with the situation by setting up international communicable diseases control checkpoints. Up to date four passengers – three Thai and one Chinese – have been detected and isolated pending further prognosis.\n*World Health Organisation Top 10 tips for riding a motorbike in Thailand (2020)\nPublished Tim Newton\nMotorbikes and scooters are the most popular mode of transport in Thailand, and most of south east Asia. Indeed, in many cases, they’re the ‘engine’ for the local economies. The 110cc step-thru is ubiquitous. Most of them just go and go and go – they’re astonishingly reliable. Whilst you’re meant to change the oil once a month we suspect most don’t get their oil changed once a year, if ever.\nGetting around on a motorbike is easy enough and, especially in busy traffic, will get you to your destination faster whilst the cars and trucks are plodding along in the traffic.\nBut riding a motorbike in Thailand can also be very dangerous. But if you stick to the common sense basics – ride within the speed limits, wear a bike helmet, obey the traffic rules and don’t drink and drive – it remains a perfectly reliable way to get around.\nMake sure you have the correct insurance before you go anywhere near a motorbike or motorcycle!!\nHere’s our Top Ten tips to make your journey on the motorbike safer and more comfortable.\nPLEASE NOTE: We’re not recommending that you should ride a motorbike but, if you do, these tips will help… 1. Wear appropriate clothes\nWhilst you’ll see idiot tourists riding around on their rented motorbikes in their swimming shorts, and that’s all, you’re going to be much safer with a few clothes on. Falling off a motorbike without anything covering your knees or elbows is going to be painful enough – having at least some fabric between you and the road is going to reduce the painful grazes a bit. Long pants and a long shirt are a good start.\nAlways wear shoes for the same reason. And a motorbike helmet as well – it’s the law and it could save your life. The flimsy plastic ‘lid’ type helmets cost around 200 baht and will get you through the checkpoints but spending a bit more on a better helmet will provide additional protection in the unlikely situation your head comes in contact with the road. You’ll see the locals riding around with their jackets on the wrong way – they say it keep their clothes clean from the road muck and fumes. 2. Keep your bike in good condition\nIt goes without saying. But as hardy and reliable as the modern motorbikes are, they will run better and for longer if you keep up the service schedule and change the oil around once a month. You will wonder how they can produce these 110-125cc step-thrus for little more than USD$1,000 brand new, but they do and the ones floating around the roads of Thailand are almost all made in the land of smiles.\nApart from changing the engine oil keep an eye on the tyres as the road surfaces in much of Thailand, plus the heat and humidity, will wear down your tread quickly. Good tread and keeping your tyres at the prescribed pressure are your best bet for maintaining control at all times. Your brakes will also need checking although, like the rest of the part of these bikes, the brakes seem to last forever.\nWhenever you’re getting your oil changed get the service man to check the brakes, tyres and make sure nuts and bolts are all tight – they shake loose sometimes.And then there’s the lights at the front and back which are your best way to inform other driver’s what you’re doing in the traffic. Indicators may not be used much by the locals but you should. 3. Make sure you have a proper license\nYour car license in your home country isn’t legal in Thailand to ride a motorbike. Your International Drivers License for cars issued in your home country isn’t going to cut it either. Legally, the only document that will satisfy the Thai legal system, officially, is a Thai motorcycle license. It doesn’t matter much until a situation arises where you’re in an accident and the law comes crashing down on you.\nIf you live in Thailand you simply must get a proper motorbike drivers license of you want to ride a motorbike here. For tourists, the local bike hire shops will gladly rent you a bike, usually by simply showing your passport and giving them a deposit. Some will even tell you that their ‘insurance’ will cover you in the event of an accident – that’s just not going to happen. YOU are responsible for your own health if you get onto a motorbike in Thailand. Check YOUR situation and YOUR health and travel insurance.\nAnd whilst we’re talking about a Thai Motorbike License, we’re talking about the ones you get from the Land Transport Office, not Khao San road for 500 baht!\n(Here’s some info about getting a motorbike license in Bangkok, the same applies at the Land Transport Offices in most Thai cities).\nWe think you’re insane getting on a motorbike in a foreign country without the correct documentation, which leads us to #4… 4. Check your travel and health insurance\nEvery week The Thaiger hears from tourists stuck in a Thai hospital with mounting hospital bills and an insurance company that won’t pay out because they didn’t have a proper drivers license. Or no insurance at all. And even if you have travel or health insurance, check the fine print because some insurance contracts preclude driving on motorbikes in Thailand.\nIn six years driving on Thai roads I’ve had one fall. It winded me badly and I got abrasions on my ankle and knee. But people ran to my assistance and helped me up. I didn’t need to go to hospital but I was grateful, lying in the middle of the road gasping for breath, that I knew I had good health insurance and a proper license.\n(The fine print on your insurance, different country’s licences and the policeman that shows up at your accident will all play a part on how your accident will play out. The ONLY sure way you can prove your legal ability to drive on a Thai road is with a Thai motorbike license) 5. Driving is different in Thailand\nMany of the rules are the same as countries that also drive on the left-hand side of the road. But you need to add ‘Thainess’ into the traffic mix. It is different. Apart from the lunatics that drive too fast, drink-drive or ghost ride (driving against the flow of traffic on the side of the road), there’s just the different attitude to driving. We say it’s a bit like swimming with a school of fish – if you just go-with-the-flow and keep in the stream of traffic you’ll do well.\nThe western attitude of driving defensively will go against the grain of Thai traffic movement where ‘personal driving space’ isn’t really honoured and people will cut in front of you as just a part of daily driving habits. It’s not wrong, it’s different and you’re best to learn the subtleties of Thai traffic flow before you immerse yourself in the middle. 6. Green lights mean GO. Red lights also mean GO sometimes.\nYou’ll see what we mean. Don’t even think about trying it. It will either get you fined or dead. 7. Have a practice\nIf you’re either new to driving a motorbike or new to driving a motorbike in Thailand don’t thrust yourself into a busy stretch of road immediately. Try something a little calmer and slower to get a feel of the subtle differences in Thai traffic movement. You’re sharing the road with trucks, cars, buses and passenger vans.\nYou’re meant to stay on the left hand side and you’d be well advised to do so, despite the behaviour of some Thai motorbike drivers that want to mix it with the ‘big boys’. Get some confidence with your motorbike and way it handles, and moving in and around traffic on a quiet road before you tackle the main roads. 8. There’s pot holes, then there’s POT HOLES\nThe roads around Thailand have really improved in the past decade but you’ll still find pot holes in places there wasn’t one the day before. If you want a really good reason for giving plenty of distance between you and the car in front, it’s to see the pot hole before you end up IN it. Whilst car tyres might glide over these holes in the road, your motorbike is likely to come to an abrupt halt, with you continuing over the front of the handlebars – something to do with Newton’s first law of motion. 9. If you’re not sure, don’t\nNever ridden a motorbike? Didn’t ride a motorbike in your own country? There’s two good reasons not to try it for your first time in Thailand.\nIt can be a bit of a challenge for even experienced motorbike drivers, well different anyway. There’s plenty of other ways to get around and if you want THAT selfie for your Facebook page there’s thousands of bikes parked by the side of the road where you can get a photo. Just because your friends did it when they travelled to Thailand doesn’t mean you have to. 10. Police will often arbitrate on the spot at an accident\nIf you are in the wrong and damaged someone or someone else’s bike you’re probably going to have to pay up. Now, there’s the ‘official’ way to sort things out in these case and the ‘unofficial’.\nThe policemen will get to the scene soon enough and, often, decide there and then who was at fault. They’ll often negotiate how much should be paid as well. The urban myth is that Thai police always side with the the locals – that’s not the case although, if you are indeed in the wrong then you’re IN THE WRONG!\nIf you are concerned that you’re being rolled by the locals in sorting out a simple motorbike accident then call the Tourist Police or your consulate immediately. DON’T agree to pay any money to anyone until you’ve spoken to at least the Tourist Police.\nGetting into an argument with the local police will almost certainly guarantee you’ll come off second best. Demanding that you speak to the police chief, etc, will also usually end up in the situation not going well in your favour. Be patient and don’t lose your cool. You are in a foreign country, you’re a guest and they do things differently – end of sentence.\nPHOTO: John Everingham 10a. If you have any doubts, just don’t\nBottomline about riding a motorbike in Thailand is that, if you 1) wear a motorbike helmet 2) never drink and drive 3) wear appropriate clothing 4) have a Thai motorbike license and 5) be aware of the traffic around you and concentrate at all times… you’ll probably have very few problems and be able to enjoy Thailand the way the locals do, au natural, with the wind through your hair and the insects up your nose.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat.

They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

READ: China pneumonia outbreak may be linked to new type of virus: WHO\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.\nThe Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases, and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests.\nHong Kong's Department of Health said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border check points, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.

That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan's outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown, but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina's transport ministry says it plans additional measures to disinfect trains, planes and buses and prevent transmission of diseases during the 40-day travel rush centred on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls this year on Jan. 25. The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n“The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" the ministry's chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n“In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,\" Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travellers to Wuhan. Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was quoted by the city's official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n\"So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.\nThe Associated Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T06:25:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The reports come a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that multiple known viruses had been ruled out as a cause of the outbreak, and that a coronavirus was the likely cause. The virus had sickened at least 59 people in China as of Sunday, and according to the Associated Press , one suspected case — a woman who fell ill after returning from China — has been identified in South Korea. Xinhua reports that the virus was identified by the Chinese Academy of Engineering's Xu Jianguo based on tests of samples from 15 patients with the illness. Known coronaviruses include some that cause a cold, as well as the pathogens behind severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). \"Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks,\" the WHO's Gauden Galea says in a statement quoted by multiple news outlets. \"If the Chinese truly have sequenced the virus and they've demonstrated that it's present in other patients, [that] means there's a PCR diagnostic test available. And the Chinese need to make that available to the rest of the world immediately,\" Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina, tells STAT . He explains that coronaviruses could be transmitted to people from bats, or through a different animal species that had been infected by a bat . \"I am stunned by the timeline and speed of this isolation and characterization, if it's all true,\" says Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in remarks to STAT . He expressed skepticism about Chinese authorities' claim that the virus can't be transmitted between humans, saying, \"I don't know how you know that at all.\" Given the number of reported cases, he says, it's not likely that animal-to-human transmission is the only way the virus can spread. David Hui, an emerging infections expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, shares a similar take with The New York Times . \"So, there are still a lot of question marks ,\" he says. \"It's premature to say that there's no human-to-human transmission.\" Comment: See also:", "external_links": ["https://www.apnews.com/30c5bf016c52748eebc6371fe3b17321", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html", "https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/09/chinese-scientists-obtain-genetic-sequence-of-mysterious-virus-a-key-step-in-containment-efforts", "https://nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html", "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/09/c_138690570.htm", "http://xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/09/c_138690570.htm", "https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/09/chinese-scientists-obtain-genetic-sequence-of-mysterious-virus-a-key-step-in-containment-efforts/", "https://statnews.com/2020/01/09/chinese-scientists-obtain-genetic-sequence-of-mysterious-virus-a-key-step-in-containment-efforts/", "https://apnews.com/30c5bf016c52748eebc6371fe3b17321"], "published": "2020-01-10T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T02:38:03.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The connection is important because SARS coronavirus, which emerged in Southern China in 2003, was acquired from open meat markets.\nA scientist leading the investigation of the new agent, Xu Jianguo, has announced that on 7 January 2020 a new coronavirus was identified. Apparently the virus was isolated from a patient and the entire genome sequence obtained. On ProMedMail he is quoted as saying “A total of 15 positive results of the new coronavirus were detected by nucleic acid detection methods” which I presume to be PCR. However it is not clear if this statement means that 15 patients have tested positive for this virus.\nPrecautions have been taken in China to limit the travel of infected individuals, for example by using thermal detectors at airports to identify people with fever. It will not be surprising if infections are detected outside of Wuhan and even in different countries, as an infected person may not have symptoms for several days.\nAt this point we have very little information on the virus and its transmissibility. However this situation is expected to change quickly as a diagnostic test (PCR) can now be used to track infections. Hopefully we will see the genome sequence very soon so we can determine the origin of the virus. Coronaviruses are known to circulate in bats in China and it will be essential to determine if the isolates in this new outbreak match anything that has been previously detected. I suspect not, given the assertion that the virus is a coronavirus never seen before. Nevertheless, having the genome sequence will allow us to trace its origins.\nCoronaviruses have been known for many years, but until 2003 they mainly caused mild upper respiratory illness. They are enveloped viruses with a (+) strand RNA genome (pictured). In 2003 SARS coronavirus emerged as the cause of severe respiratory disease. That virus originated in cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in China, and was introduced into humans at live meat markets in Guangdong Province. MERS coronavirus emerged in the Middle East in 2012 and cases continue to be reported. It is mainly (but not always) acquired from camels, but it likely entered camels from bats some time ago. Hence coronaviruses have a proven record of causing zoonotic infections.\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak, China was very slow at sharing information about the outbreak with the rest of the world. Such sharing is important because it allows other countries to detect and control the virus should it arrive. Apparently there are still issues with the current outbreak, although information is more forthcoming. For example, as reported in the NY Times , Chinese censors have blocked the hashtag #WuhanSARS on social media, and eight people are being investigated for spreading rumors online about the disease. Hopefully the sharing of information about the virus will be more open.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html", "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/", "https://www.promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6878869", "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6878869", "https://nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html"], "published": "2020-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T03:09:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Forty-one people with pneumonia-like symptoms have so far been diagnosed with the new type of coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where it was first confirmed, with one of the victims dying, the city’s health commission said on its website. Seven others remained in serious condition while two were discharged from treatment, it added, saying the latest tally was completed on Friday. The commission did not specify when the death occurred or give further details on the patient other than to say the bulk of those diagnosed worked at a Wuhan seafood market that was closed January 1 following the outbreak. The episode has caused alarm due to the link to SARS, or Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. State-run Xinhua news agency reported on Friday that Chinese scientists investigating the outbreak had made a “preliminary” determination that it was a previously unknown type of coronavirus. The WHO says coronaviruses are a large family of pathogens ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012 and also caused scores of deaths. “No new cases have been detected since January 3, 2020,” the Wuhan health commission said. “At present, no infections among medical staff have been found, and no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.” Wuhan authorities had earlier said 59 people had fallen ill, but Saturday’s statement suggests that not all have been confirmed as cases of the new virus. The outbreak was first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, which has a population of more than 11 million. Authorities in Hong Kong have since taken precautions including stepping up the disinfection of trains and planes, and checks of passengers. The WHO, however, said Thursday it was not recommending any specific measures for travellers, nor the application of any trade or travel restrictions on China based on current information, expressing confidence in the ability of Chinese authorities to manage the situation. China has since ruled out a fresh recurrence of SARS. – Travel rush looms – China has entered its annual Lunar New Year holiday travel rush, raising the spectre of the mass movement of people serving as a vector for the pathogen’s spread. In the world’s largest annual human migration, hundreds of millions of people are expected to pack together on trains, buses and planes for the Lunar New Year holiday that this year falls in late January. Authorities have said 400 million train tickets have been purchased for holiday-related travel, with hundreds of millions more expected to travel by air and road. China has not announced any travel restrictions. Authorities in Hong Kong have said 48 people have been hospitalised in recent days after returning from Wuhan and displaying flu-like illnesses, but none were confirmed to have contracted the new coronavirus. City residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week. The coming holiday has prompted concerns in Taiwan, where officials urged the island’s health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls at airports.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be traveling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.\nThe Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases, and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests.\nHong Kong's Department of Health said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border check points, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh; Additional reporting by Sophie Yu in Beijing and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Editing by Sandra Maler and Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T02:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T08:33:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Seven are currently in a critical condition.\nA new virus arriving on the scene, leaving patients with pneumonia, is always a worry and health officials around the world are on high alert.\nBut is this a brief here-today-gone-tomorrow outbreak or the first sign of something far more dangerous? What is this virus?\nViral samples have been taken from patients and analysed in the laboratory.\nAnd officials in China and the World Health Organization have concluded the infection is a coronavirus.\nCoronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which is caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002.\n\"There is a strong memory of Sars, that's where a lot of fear comes from, but we're a lot more prepared to deal with those types of diseases,\" says Dr Josie Golding, from the Wellcome Trust. Is it serious?\nCoronaviruses can cause symptoms ranging from a mild cold all the way through to death.\nThis new virus appears to be somewhere in the middle.\n\"When we see a new coronavirus, we want to know how severe are the symptoms - this is more than cold-like symptoms and that is a concern but it is not as severe as Sars,\" says Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There were six coronaviruses known to infect people. Where has it come from?\nNew viruses are detected all the time.\nThey jump from one species, where they went unnoticed, into humans.\n\"If we think about outbreaks in the past, if it is a new coronavirus, it will have come from an animal reservoir,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham.\nSars jumped from the civet cat into humans.\nAnd Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which has killed 858 out of the 2,494 recorded cases since it emerged in 2012 , regularly makes the jump from the dromedary camel. Which animal?\nOnce the animal reservoir where the virus normally camps out is detected, the problem becomes much easier to deal with.\nThe cases have been linked to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, in Wuhan.\nBut while some sea-going mammals can carry coronaviruses ( such as the Beluga whale ), the market also has live wild animals, including chickens, bats, rabbits, snakes, which are more likely to be the source. Why China?\nProf Woolhouse says it is because of the size and density of the population and close contact with animals harbouring viruses.\n\"No-one is surprised the next outbreak is in China or that part of the world,\" he says. How easily does it spread?\nPerhaps the single most reassuring fact about this outbreak is that the new virus does not appear to spread from one person to another.\nThis is a major concern with new viruses that infect the lungs, as coughs and sneezes are a highly effective way for a virus to spread.\nIf it was going person-to-person, then you would expect cases in healthcare workers as they come into close contact with sick patients.\nChinese officials say that has not happened.\nHowever, some experts have cautioned it may be too soon to know whether there is human-to-human transmission.\nProf Ball says: \"There would have to be 59 animal-to-human transmission events in a short amount of time, intuitively that does seem quite high, it is still an open question.\"\nProf Woolhouse says: \"I'm cautious rather than sceptical, it is early too tell - most coronaviruses are actually transmissible and that would be my initial concern.\" How fast is it spreading?\nSo far, not very.\nAll the 59 patients had symptoms start between 12 December and 29 December 2019.\nAnd there have been no further cases reported.\n\"It's positive that we've not seen an expansion in cases,\" Dr Golding says.\n\"China is taking it seriously and it could be contained, we have to wait and see.\"\nConcerns remain, however, that the virus could be spread by the hundreds of millions of people travelling for Chinese New Year later this month. How have Chinese authorities responded? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Temperature screening can help identify people who have been infected\nInfected people have been treated in isolation to minimise the risk of the bug spreading.\nMore than 150 people who have had contact with infected patients are being monitored for signs of the disease.\nExtra checks such as temperature scans have been put in place to screen travellers.\nAnd the seafood market was closed for cleaning and disinfection. How worried are the experts?\nDr Golding says: \"At the moment, until we have more information, it's really hard to know how worried we should be.\n\"Until we have confirmation of the source, that's always going to make us uneasy.\"\nProf Ball says: \"We should be worried about any virus that explores humans for the first time, because it's overcome the first major barrier.\n\"Once inside a [human] cell and replicating, it can start to generate mutations that could allow it to spread more efficiently and become more dangerous.\n\"You don't want to give the virus the opportunity.\" ", "external_links": ["https://who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china#.XhboyJuKMZg.twitter", "https://who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/", "https://www.jvi.asm.org/content/82/10/5084", "https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html", "https://jvi.asm.org/content/82/10/5084", "https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en", "https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china#.XhboyJuKMZg.twitter", "https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/"], "published": "2020-01-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T03:35:02.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The last thing it needs is another quintessentially east-asian public health crisis.\nHeadlines about a new pneumonia-like illness spreading through China have appeared in the Western press over the past week . Officials in the region, including in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have been fearful of the virus's spread since Beijing delivered a notice warning about the virus on Dec. 31, when just 27 people were infected. As of Thursday, a little more than a week later, the number had risen to 59 - with seven in critical condition.\nNow, it appears public health officials worst fears have been confirmed: Preliminary tests indicate the mysterious illness may be caused by a new coronavirus, according to lead scientist Xu Jianguo, who delivered the news to China's official Xinhua news agency, according to the BBC.\nXu said he and his researchers found the \"new type\" of coronavirus by testing infected blood samples and throat swabs collected from 15 people.\nCrucially, coronaviruses can be the cause of a wide range of illnesses, from common colds, to infections like the SARS virus that originated in China in 2002 and 2003 and ended up killing 700 people around the world.\nCourtesy of the BBC\nBeijing's confirmation seems to affirm the WHO's suspicion that a coronavirus could be to blame for the outbreak.\nWhile identifying the virus type is a start for authorities, \"further investigations\" are still necessary, said Gauden Galea, The WHO representative for China. For example, pathology investigators still need to understand how the virus spreads.\nSo far, zero cases of human to human transmission have been confirmed, while the Wuhan cases are thought to have been caused through exposure to animals linked to a live seafood and animal market. Of note, no healthcare workers have fallen ill with the mystery virus.\nRemember, the problem isn't just that this virus is happening, it's that it's happening now, just before millions of Chinese travel to see family and friends during the Chinese New Year holiday.

There is no vaccine or treatment for SARS or MERS, which are epidemic threats.\nAD “According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people,” it said.\nCoronaviruses cause illnesses of differing severity, the WHO said. Some transmit easily. Novel coronaviruses emerge periodically, with SARS emerging in southern China in 2002 and MERS a decade later.\nAD SARS caused 774 deaths, while MERS, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia, has killed 851 people.\nNone of these 195 countries — the U.S. included — is fully prepared for a pandemic\nAs surveillance improves, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.\nThe WHO said more comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen and to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, how the illness is spread and the extent of infection.\nIn its statement Thursday, the WHO praised China for its efforts thus far. Public health experts have raised concerns about the lack of predictable and daily communication from Chinese leaders in charge of the response about what is known and remains unknown about the outbreak.\nAD AD Chinese investigators conducted gene sequencing of the virus, using an isolate from one positive patient sample. “Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks, the WHO said.\nChina has “strong public health capacities and resources to respond and manage respiratory disease outbreaks,” WHO said. In addition to treating the patients in care and isolating new cases as they are identified, WHO said Chinese public health officials “remain focused on continued contact tracing, conducting environmental assessments at the seafood market, and investigations to identify the pathogen causing the outbreak.”\nWHO also said it continues to monitor the situation closely and, together with its partners, is ready to provide technical support to China to investigate and respond to the outbreak.\nAD AD Symptoms of the new Wuhan pneumonia include fever and invasive lesions on the lungs when viewedon chest radiographs.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory Wednesday to clinicians about screening patients with severe respiratory symptoms for travel history to Wuhan.\nAmong the chief concerns about the outbreak is how readily this respiratory illness spreads from one person to another. So far, there have been no reports of infection among health-care workers treating patients or among family members who have not had the same exposure to the source, infectious disease experts said.\n“Then the level of concern is somewhat reduced, although it can always happen later and infections can change,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, a London-based global biomedical research charity.\nAD AD “In Wuhan, there has not been a new confirmed case for around two weeks and the evidence does not suggest any human to human transmission,” he said in a statement. “Both of these are every reassuring for now.”\nIf the new virus is behaving like MERS, there could be some limited human to human transmission, which could explain why there have been clusters of cases in hospitals, said Andrew Rambaut, an infectious diseases professor at the University of Edinburgh whose research focuses on the evolution of emerging human viral pathogens.\nThat could be from ill people in hospitals infecting each other, he said. Those cases would likely be severe infections.\nAD When MERS hit Saudi Arabia, individuals were getting infected from camels. Many of the hospitalized cases were people with underlying health conditions, with many mild cases detected only using a test developed for the virus. The mild infections seem not to transmit to others, he said, “so they are dead-ends for the virus.”\nAD As a result, MERS tends to cause small, self-limiting clusters of cases. MERS infections are still happening because there is ongoing exposure of people to infected camels, he said.\nIn China, authorities have not yet identified the source of the virus. It’s almost certain to be a mammal because coronaviruses are mainly mammalian viruses, Rambaut said.\nAD Chinese authorities have closed the wild animal market in Wuhan. If that is the source, the outbreak would likely go away, he said. But the virus will still be out there in the animals somewhere, so it is important to find the direct source.\nAuthorities also need to create a fast and sensitive test for the new virus that can detect it in clinical samples. “Once you know what you are looking for, it is much easier to find it,” Rambaut said.\nOver the past week, people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports. WHO is not recommending any specific measures for travelers, and is advising against any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available.\nAD China’s transport officials told reporters Thursday that they will take measures, such as disinfecting transportation hubs, to prevent the spread of the illness during the Lunar New Year period later this month, when more than 400 million Chinese are expected to travel.\nSun reported from Washington.\nSpecter of possible new virus emerging from central China raises alarms across Asia\nNone of these 195 countries — the U.S. included — is fully prepared for a pandemic\nA pandemic is killing pigs around the world, and U.S. pork producers fear they could be hit next\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "external_links": ["https://www.twitter.com/@bylenasun", "https://scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3044912/hong-kong-urged-tighten-health-checks-visitors", "https://twitter.com/@bylenasun", "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3044912/hong-kong-urged-tighten-health-checks-visitors"], "published": "2020-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T09:56:11.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

destination.\nBut Tian, a tourist from another metropolis around three hours’ drive away, decided to make the trip despite trepidation from his family over reports of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak.\n“I said I should be fine, so I came,” he told AFP after checking out of his hotel on Sunday, wearing a face mask as a precaution nonetheless.\nResidents of the central city seem just as unconcerned about the disease, believed to be from the same family as SARS – an infectious coronavirus that killed hundreds of people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.\nSo far 41 people with pneumonia-like symptoms have been diagnosed with the new virus in Wuhan, with authorities disclosing on Saturday the death of a 61-year-old man two days earlier.\nThe outbreak began just weeks before China’s busiest annual travel period, and national plane and rail authorities are closely watching developments as millions prepare to visit family at Lunar New Year.\nNo clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has yet been detected, according to the local health commission.\nHuanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city centre – where multiple pneumonia patients worked – is still cordoned off after being shut down on Jan 1.\nBut multiple restaurants sharing the same building were open and serving customers early Sunday morning.\nInitial reports about the virus had raised fears that SARS was back, prompting authorities to punish eight people for posting false information online.\nWhile the outbreak sparked a run on face masks at pharmacies in Hong Kong, where scientists urged people to stay vigilant, few on the streets of central Wuhan were sporting masks this weekend.\nMost of the guards stationed around the seafood market were not wearing protective gear, although one group of security staff who had entered the market area wore masks and hats and were instructed at a morning briefing to stay covered at all times.\nMultiple people without safety equipment were seen exiting and entering the market, however, while some guards appeared more concerned about the spread of unflattering images than contagion.\nOne of them threatened to track down AFP reporters for filming a confrontation between the guards and an elderly man who wanted to enter the market.\nThe same guard said merchants had been allowed to enter the facility to check on their stalls, accompanied by security staff.\nChinese scientists said last week they believe the pathogen is a previously unknown type of coronavirus – a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS.\nHong Kong’s Department of Health said Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus found in one of the Wuhan patients indicated it was 80 per cent similar to SARS found in bats.\nBut they said it was too soon to conclude that it was a SARS strain.\nOutside the medical centre in Wuhan where the infected are being treated, patients discharged after being seen for other illnesses waited for buses and taxis, some without face masks.\nVisitors were free to enter and exit the hospital compound, although a guard physically blocked AFP from filming a group of patients moving between buildings, saying it was a “sensitive” scene.\nTwo women surnamed Yan and Shu who had been discharged said on Sunday that hospital authorities had pushed overnight for as many patients unrelated to the pneumonia outbreak to be sent home as possible.\n“Most of the building is empty,” Shu said, adding that she believed more pneumonia patients would soon be transferred there.\nAnother woman surnamed Yan, waiting for a bus near the hospital with her husband and 3-year-old daughter, said she was concerned about the virus but felt there was little point in worrying.\n“If the illness looks for us, there’s nothing we can do,” she said.\nHer husband Cao said most of their neighbours in the Wuchang distri\nct across the river from Huanan market were “not worried“, as they rarely

confirmed Monday the first case in Thailand of a new virus from the same family as SARS that is behind a Chinese pneumonia outbreak.\nThe UN health agency said a person travelling from Wuhan, China, had been hospitalized in Thailand on January 8 after being diagnosed with mild pneumonia.\n\"Laboratory testing subsequently confirmed that the novel coronavirus was the cause,\" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP in an email, referring to the new virus.\nWHO said it might soon host an emergency meeting on the spread of the new virus.\nThe case marks the first outside of China, where 41 people with pneumonia-like symptoms have so far been diagnosed with the new virus in the central city of Wuhan, with one of the victims dying last Thursday.\nThe episode has caused alarm due to the spectre of SARS, or Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which in 2002-2003 killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong, whose economy was hit hard by the epidemic's devastating impact on tourism.\nThe WHO has confirmed that the outbreak in China has been caused by a previously unknown type of corona virus, a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS.\nThe agency said Monday it had been informed by Thai health officials that the patient there was recovering from the illness.\nIt stressed that it was not surprising that the virus had spread beyond China.\n\"The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected, and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,\" it said in a statement.\nIt pointed out that it had issued guidance on how to detect and treat people who fall ill with the new virus, and stressed that China's decision to rapidly share the genetic sequencing of the virus made it possible to quickly diagnose patients.\nWHO has not recommended any specific measures for travellers or restrictions on trade with China, but stressed Monday it was taking the situation seriously.\n\"Given developments, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will consult with Emergency Committee members and could call for a meeting of the committee on short notice,\" it said in a statement.\n ", "external_links":

It belongs to the strain of Corona virus. What is known about SARS? DW takes a look.According to the Berlin-based virus researcher Christian Drosten, the pathogen that has been circulating in Wuhan, China, since the turn of the year is a SARS virus similar to the one that caused a pandemic in 2002. \"It is the same type of virus, only in a different variant,\" the director of the Institute of Virology at the Charité in Berlin told dpa. The differences are mainly in the proteins with which the virus attaches to human cells. During the Sars pandemic, which originated in China, around 8000 cases were recorded worldwide, killing more than 800 people. To date, the Chinese authorities have reported 41 confirmed cases of the new pathogen, meaning that several patients are in critical condition. A 61-year-old man with severe pre-existing conditions is said to have died from the infection.\nThere are also suspected cases in Thailand, South Korea and Singapore. However, Drosten said that these should be evaluated with caution, even if there is a supposed laboratory confirmation. SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is a viral infection of the lungs. What are the symptoms of SARS?\nSARS begins with high fever (over 38 degrees Celsius), severe sore throat, painful coughing and difficulty breathing. Then there are the classic flu symptoms such as headaches, diarrhoea, general achyness and muscle stiffness. SARS can be diagnosed, among other things, by an X-ray of the lungs. Top 10 most dangerous viruses in the world Where does SARS come from?\nThe virus belongs to a strain of the Corona virus. Presumably it is caused by a mutation or genetic exchange with other viruses. It is considered likely that it has spread from animals - originally from the civet cat - to humans. SARS first appeared in 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong, which had repeatedly made headlines in the past as the source of dangerous infectious diseases.\nIn Guangdong, a large number of people live together in a dense area. In addition, poor hygienic conditions favour the development of dangerous virus types such as SARS. What is known about the SARS pathogen? Corona viruses belong to a group of pathogens that can develop many particularly variants - the RNA viruses.\nThey copy their genetic material very quickly and very often. This can result in many different virus variants. It also makes the development of vaccines difficult. The pathogen can be detected in the laboratory; the infected person forms antibodies that can be identified with a test.\nThe method responds to even the smallest concentrations of the pathogen. Less than 1000 viruses per milliliter are sufficient. In a sick person, the concentration is several hundreds of thousands of viruses per milliliter. What is the incubation period of SARS?\nThe incubation period is the time between the infection of a human being and the outbreak of the disease. According to previous experience, the incubation period for SARS is two to seven days. In rare cases, the disease can still break out ten days after infection. Can SARS be treated?\nIt is possible to alleviate the course of the disease. In the first wave of SARS, all patients suspected of having SARS were quarantined and treated in special hospital areas to prevent the disease from spreading further. Doctors and nurses had access to the patients only with protective suits and a special breathing apparatus. What is the chance of survival for patients?\nIt is estimated that SARS is fatal in three to five percent of all cases. Conventional pneumonia, in contrast, is fatal in up to 10 percent of all cases. People who have successfully fought the SARS virus generally do not have to expect permanent damage. How can you protect yourself? It is advisable to avoid crowds of people in the affected areas to prevent possible infection via droplet infection. A mouth and nose protector can also protect against infection. However, such protection can not stop all viruses, but only reduce the risk of infection.\n DW (English)", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-14T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-14T17:50:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Lauren DeCicca, Getty Images\nA new strain of coronavirus has been discovered in China. Health officials think it’s the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus’s genome from one patient’s samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the “corona.”\n“Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,” says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don’t seem to have gotten sick, it’s reasonable to believe that the virus doesn’t spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it’s too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn’t spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n“If it’s in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,” compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it’s infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n“It’s a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,” she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It’s a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n“Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,” says Menachery. “The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.”\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there’s no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it’s possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the “scared or not scared” scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn’t spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he’ll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that’s a historic warning sign for pandemics.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong) By The Associated Press The Associated Press\nBANGKOK (AP) — A Chinese visitor to Thailand has been confirmed to be infected with a new strain of coronavirus that has been linked to a pneumonia outbreak in central China, health officials said Monday.\nThe U.N.’s World Health Organization said Thai officials have reported that a traveler from the Chinese city of Wuhan has been hospitalized in Thailand with the virus.\nThe outbreak of the virus has been traced to Wuhan, where it affected several dozen people who had been to a major meat and seafood market.\nThai Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said it appears to be the first confirmed case of the virus found outside China, the Bangkok Post newspaper and other Thai media reported.\nHe identified the infected tourist as a 61-year-old woman whose symptoms were detected on arrival at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport last Wednesday. Her coronavirus was confirmed Sunday by a laboratory test, Anutin said.\nShe has been treated at an isolation ward at a state health facility outside of Bangkok, and no longer has any fever or respiratory symptoms, he said. Advertising\nEight other people with possible symptoms have also been held at the facility, he said, but none has been confirmed to have the virus.\nA statement issued Monday by the Geneva-based World Health Organization said it is working with officials in Thailand and China following the report of the confirmed case outside China. The agency says its director-general is consulting with the agency’s emergency committee, which generally decides whether viral outbreaks merit an expanded response from health authorities.\n“The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected, and reinforces why WHO calls for ongoing active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,” the agency said. “WHO reiterates that it is essential that investigations continue in China to identify the source of this outbreak and any animal reservoirs or intermediate hosts.”\nThe virus is not believed to be spread by human-to-human contact.\nOfficials in Wuhan said over the weekend that a total of 41 people were suffering from pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus and a 61-year-old man had died — China’s first known death from the virus.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown but has sought to play down speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved to cause more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images\nH ealth authorities on Monday identified a pneumonia case caused by a previously unknown virus in Thailand — the first known infection outside of China, where the virus is thought to have begun spreading last month.\nThe patient is a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, the city where the outbreak is occurring, health officials said. Thai authorities identified her as a 61-year-old woman who was recovering at a hospital in Nonthaburi province, the Bangkok Post reported .\nChinese authorities have been moving quickly to control the spread of the virus, and nearby countries have been ramping up surveillance efforts and isolating people who develop respiratory infections after travel to Wuhan.

Knowing the sequence allows health officials to differentiate respiratory infections caused by the novel coronavirus versus those caused by other viruses — a key step particularly during flu season.\nThai health authorities reported that the woman was confirmed to be infected by the coronavirus, and that 16 people who were close to the woman on her flight were examined and did not show signs of the virus, according to the Bangkok Post.\nThe then-unexplained pneumonia cases started appearing in Wuhan — a city 700 miles south of Beijing — on Dec. 12. They attracted global attention in part because of the similarities of the cases to the SARS outbreak in 2003, when that virus went on to spread from China to Hong Kong and then to Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, and Toronto, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800.\nRelated: First death from Wuhan pneumonia outbreak reported as scientists release DNA sequence of virus In a statement Monday , Wuhan health officials reported 41 infections from the coronavirus — the same figure as late last week, when they said they had not confirmed any new infections since Jan. 3.

The Wuhan outbreak has been linked to a large seafood market that also sells the meat of exotic animals. The market was closed Jan. 1.\nHealth authorities in Wuhan have said they have not identified any human transmission of the virus, meaning that each case would have come from the person being exposed to the virus from an animal. Outside experts have noted, however, that it can be very difficult to confirm person-to-person spread at this point in the outbreak.\nIn Wuhan, health authorities have been following 763 close contacts of the people who were infected, including more than 400 health workers, but have not identified any cases among them.", "external_links": ["http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011309038", "http://www.wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011309038"], "published": "2020-01-13T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-13T16:01:51.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The seafood market in Wuhan — a major domestic and international transport hub — is now closed and no cases have been reported elsewhere in China or internationally, it said.\n“The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan,” the WHO statement said, adding that the market was closed on January 1. “At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission.”\nThe WHO said last week that a newly emerging member of the 'coronavirus' family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks was the likely cause of the outbreak.\nCoronaviruses can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some types cause less serious disease, while others can be far more severe.\nAmong 41 people confirmed as infected with the new viral pneumonia, one — a 61-year-old man with serious underlying medical conditions — died last week. Seven others are in critical condition, the Wuhan health authorities said on Saturday.\nThe WHO said preliminary epidemiological investigations had found most cases were in people who either worked at or were frequent visitors to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\n“To date, investigations are still under way to assess the full extent of the outbreak,” it added. — Reuters Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-13T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-13T04:02:29.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

pneumonia outbreak.\n“I said I should be fine, so I came,” he told AFP after checking out of his hotel on Sunday, wearing a face mask as a precaution nonetheless.\nResidents of the central city seem just as unconcerned about the disease, believed to be from the same family as SARS — an infectious coronavirus that killed hundreds of people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.\nSo far 41 people with pneumonia-like symptoms have been diagnosed with the new virus in Wuhan, with authorities disclosing on Saturday the death of a 61-year-old man two days earlier.\nThe outbreak began just weeks before China’s busiest annual travel period, and national plane and rail authorities are closely watching developments as millions prepare to visit family at Lunar New Year.\nNo clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has yet been detected, according to the local health commission.\nHuanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city centre — where multiple pneumonia patients worked — is still cordoned off after being shut down on January 1.\nBut multiple restaurants sharing the same building were open and serving customers early Sunday morning.\nInitial reports about the virus had raised fears that SARS was back, prompting authorities to punish eight people for posting false information online.\nWhile the outbreak sparked a run on face masks at pharmacies in Hong Kong, where scientists urged people to stay vigilant, few on the streets of central Wuhan were sporting masks this weekend.\nMost of the guards stationed around the seafood market were not wearing protective gear, although one group of security staff who had entered the market area wore masks and hats and were instructed at a morning briefing to stay covered at all times.\nMultiple people without safety equipment were seen exiting and entering the market, however, while some guards appeared more concerned about the spread of unflattering images than contagion.\nOne of them threatened to track down AFP reporters for filming a confrontation between the guards and an elderly man who wanted to enter the market.\nThe same guard said merchants had been allowed to enter the facility to check on their stalls, accompanied by security staff.\n-‘Nothing you can do’-\nChinese scientists said last week they believe the pathogen is a previously unknown type of coronavirus — a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS.\nHong Kong’s Department of Health said Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus found in one of the Wuhan patients indicated it was 80 percent similar to SARS found in bats.\nBut they said it was too soon to conclude that it was a SARS strain.\nOutside the medical centre in Wuhan where the infected are being treated, patients discharged after being seen for other illnesses waited for buses and taxis, some without face masks.\nVisitors were free to enter and exit the hospital compound, although a guard physically blocked AFP from filming a group of patients moving between buildings, saying it was a “sensitive” scene.\nTwo women surnamed Yan and Shu who had been discharged said on Sunday that hospital authorities had pushed overnight for as many patients unrelated to the pneumonia outbreak to be sent home as possible.\n“Most of the building is empty,” Shu said, adding that she believed more pneumonia patients would soon be transferred there.\nAnother woman surnamed Yan, waiting for a bus near the hospital with her husband and three-year-old daughter, said she was concerned about the virus but felt there was little point in worrying.\n“If the illness looks for us, there’s nothing we can do,” she said.\nHer husband Cao said most of their neighbours in the Wuchang district across the river from Huanan market were “not worried”, as they rarely crossed over to the other side of the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-13T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-13T18:21:36.012+02:00",

An outbreak at the same facility in 2018 killed 11 children. No children died or were hospitalized in the latest incident, the health department said.\nThe virus, identified as coronavirus, was different from the adenovirus that caused the deaths of 11 ventilator-dependent children 15 months ago and inspired a new law aimed to reduce deaths from respiratory outbreaks in long-term care facilities.\nThe Phoenix Center for Rehabilitation and Pediatrics in Haskell. (Photo: Tariq Zehawi and Peter Carr USA Today Network)\n\"Everyone experiencing the cold-like symptoms is back to normal now,\" said Natasha Islam, who became the nursing home administrator in late October. The facility, which had been called the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, has been sold and was renamed the Phoenix Center for Rehabilitation and Pediatrics on Jan. 1.\nThe latest outbreak was first reported to state officials on Dec. 18, when four children received confirmed diagnoses of coronavirus, a respiratory virus that typically causes symptoms of the common cold, said Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department.\nNursing home residents are more vulnerable to complications and even death from such viruses, because of their medical conditions. Many of the Wanaque center's pediatric patients rely on ventilators to breathe or gastric tubes to receive nourishment.\nIn the following days, six more children in the pediatric unit became ill with coronavirus. A geriatric patient on another floor was hospitalized with the virus, and a staff member tested positive for it, said Leusner. Neither Leusner nor Islam provided the condition of the elderly patient on Friday.\nOpen records: A year after Wanaque deaths, NJ still refuses to release documents showing its response\nWanaque virus outbreak: Giving voice to the voiceless reminded me why I became a journalist\nNo new cases have been identified since Dec. 21, so the Health Department declared the outbreak over Friday.\nThe facility \"worked closely with the Passaic County Department of Health and the [state health department] to institute measures to control the outbreak,\" Leusner said.\nThat included separating residents into three groups: those who were ill, those who had been exposed but were not ill, and those who had not been exposed. Residents were monitored closely for signs of illness. Staff and equipment were also separated to avoid spreading the virus.\nThe nursing home maintained daily contact with the state and followed all of its recommendations, said Islam. As of Friday, restrictions had been lifted, she said.\nAn image of a coronavirus. (Photo: USA Today)\nA medical expert said human coronaviruses are \"common respiratory tract viruses that most of us will get in our lifetime.\"\nThe virus gets its name from the shape of its surface proteins, whose spikes resemble a crown, said Julia A. Piwoz, pediatric infectious diseases section chief at the Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital at Hackensack University Medical Center.\nLike other respiratory viruses, coronaviruses spread through droplets from coughs and sneezes and on contaminated surfaces, so hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette (covering your cough, disposing of tissues) that health experts stress during the flu season applies to this virus strain as well. There is no specific treatment for coronaviruses aside from supportive care.\nThirty-six children and one staff member became ill at the center and 11 children died in an outbreak of adenovirus in October and November 2018.\nFederal inspectors cited the facility and its leadership for its failure to act quickly enough as the crisis unfolded. Delays in testing and treating the children, and a lack of preparation for an outbreak contributed to the deaths, the federal report said. The state cited lax infection control and poor handwashing. The center was ordered to pay a penalty of $600,000, which it contested.\nIn the aftermath, two lawsuits have been filed — one by the family of a child who died, and the other by the family of a child who became sick and survived.\nLawmakers also passed new requirements for nursing homes to have plans in advance to respond to disease outbreaks. The plans must address the sort of shortcomings that were identified at the Wanaque center, and include preparations to isolate and separate sick and at-risk residents and to promptly notify residents, their families, staff and visitors of an outbreak.\nThe state approved a license transfer last year for the facility to the new owners. The center has 92 beds for children and 135 for adults, and is operated by the North Jersey Pediatric & Adult Nursing and Wellness Center, LLC.\nLindy Washburn is a senior healthcare reporter for NorthJersey.com.

This is not such a situation. “Mystery pneumonia” are two words that you never want to hear together. It is also what has already afflicted at least 44 people in Wuhan, China. According to a statement from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission , symptoms have included fever, abnormal findings in both lungs on chest X-rays, and in some cases difficulty breathing. Eleven patients are currently critically ill.\nHere is a China Global Television Network (CGTN) report on the outbreak:\nThe word “pneumonia” is like the word “meme.” It only tells you what something generally looks like and not any specifics about the content. Pneumonia is a very general term for inflammation of the alveoli that results in the accumulation of fluid and other gunk. Alveoli, which rhymes with “bow tie,” are the very little balloon-like sacs that form grape-like clusters at the end of your respiratory tract in your lungs as seen in this picture:\nIllustration: Getty Images\nGetty Your alveoli are pretty darn important. The air that you breathe in through your nose and mouth is supposed to be filled with oxygen. This air then goes down your windpipe into your bronchi all the way to fill up your alveoli. Your alveoli are interlaced with lots of blood vessels that carry blood that’s been through your body. this blood has picked up a lot of carbon dioxide formed as waste products from your cells’ metabolism. Your alveoli serve as a point of exchange like an eBay where some products are being picked up and others are being dumped, or rather offered. In this case, oxygen swaps into the blood and carbon dioxide swaps out into the alveoli to then be exhaled. Throw in some inflammation, fluid, and gunk, and the oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange may not work so well.\nThe severity of the pneumonia really depends on how extensive it is and what’s causing it. Pneumonia is rarely a completely minor thing. You don’t usually say, “oh, I went shopping, had a little pneumonia, took some selfies, texted with some friends, and had a smashed chickpea salad sandwich, so my day was uneventful, except for the smashed chickpea salad sandwich.” Pneumonia typically requires medical attention. But it can range in severity up to being a life-threatening emergency.\nLots of things can cause pneumonia, including many different types of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The only way to really tell what’s causing the pneumonia is to take samples from either the lungs or the sputum and fluid produced by the lungs and check for different microorganisms. However, even this may not be able to tell for sure, because microrganisms are very, very small. It’s not like trying to find a ferret in your lungs. Instead, doctors have to rely on different tests for known microorganisms. If the culprit is something very unusual or even completely new, then it may take a while for doctors to figure out what’s to blame.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has indicated that they have already ruled out more common causes of viral pneumonia such as influenza, avian influenza, and adenovirus infection. Some of the patients were from the Wuhan South China Seafood City, so authorities are looking into possible exposures to different sea creatures. Sea creatures may be tasty but they also can carry their share of different microbes.\nThe big concern is whether this virus, or whatever is causing the outbreak, can spread from human-to-human. Patients do remain in isolation at Wuhan medical institutions to prevent further spread, although the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission stated that at present there is “no clear evidence” that someone with this particular pneumonia can pass infections along to other humans. “No clear evidence” is not quite the same as “ruled out.” For example, even there is “no clear evidence” that you had an accident in your pants, you may not be able to “rule it out.” So all of this bears further watching.\nWith limited information, it is difficult to tell how concerned everyone should be about what’s going on in Wuhan. This may not be SARS, which rhymes with “cars,” stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a coronavirus, and can kill up to 50% of people who have it . But either way, a mysterious pneumonia is not something that anyone should take lightly, regardless of how severe it may be. Sometimes it is better to take the mystery out of life.\n", "external_links": ["http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010309017", "http://www.wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010309017", "http://cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward", "http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward"], "published": "2020-01-03T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-04T04:01:49.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

But it can range in severity up to being a life-threatening emergency.\nLots of things can cause pneumonia, including many different types of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The only way to really tell what’s causing the pneumonia is to take samples from either the lungs or the sputum and fluid produced by the lungs and check for different microorganisms. However, even this may not be able to tell for sure, because microrganisms are very, very small. It’s not like trying to find a ferret in your lungs. Instead, doctors have to rely on different tests for known microorganisms. If the culprit is something very unusual or even completely new, then it may take a while for doctors to figure out what’s to blame.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has indicated that they have already ruled out more common causes of viral pneumonia such as influenza, avian influenza, and adenovirus infection. Some of the patients were from the Wuhan South China Seafood City, so authorities are looking into possible exposures to different sea creatures. Sea creatures may be tasty but they also can carry their share of different microbes.\nThe big concern is whether this virus, or whatever is causing the outbreak, can spread from human-to-human. Patients do remain in isolation at Wuhan medical institutions to prevent further spread, although the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission stated that at present there is “no clear evidence” that someone with this particular pneumonia can pass infections along to other humans. “No clear evidence” is not quite the same as “ruled out.” For example, even there is “no clear evidence” that you had an accident in your pants, you may not be able to “rule it out.” So all of this bears further watching.\nWith limited information, it is difficult to tell how concerned everyone should be about what’s going on in Wuhan. This may not be SARS, which rhymes with “cars,” stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a coronavirus, and can kill up to 50% of people who have it . But either way, a mysterious pneumonia is not something that anyone should take lightly, regardless of how severe it may be. Sometimes it is better to take the mystery out of life.", "external_links": ["http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010309017", "http://www.wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010309017", "http://cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward", "http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward"], "published": "2020-01-03T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-04T00:12:43.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Shares (Image: © Shutterstock)\nAn unidentified form of viral pneumonia has struck several dozen people in the Chinese city of Wuhan, sparking concerns that the country may be facing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\nBack in 2002 and 2003, SARS spread to 26 countries, infecting more than 8,000 people with a severe, flu-like illness and claiming more than 750 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak began in China, where 349 people died from the disease on the mainland and 299 more perished in Hong Kong, according to Asian news channel CNA . The SARS virus spreads through person-to-person contact and can be expelled from an infected individual when they cough or sneeze, contaminating both people and nearby objects. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that China was free of SARS in 2004, but now, a mysterious bout of viral illness has led to speculation that the disease is back.\nForty-four cases of the unidentified illness have been reported so far, including 11 \"severe\" cases, according to the international news agency AFP . Many of the infected individuals were stall holders at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which health authorities have closed until further notice, according to the South China Morning Post . In a further effort to contain the outbreak, airports in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan have ramped up screenings for fever among their passengers.\nRelated: The 9 Deadliest Viruses on Earth\nThe cause of the infections remains unknown, but the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has ruled out \"influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases\" as potential culprits, according to TK. \"At this point, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not yet confirmed or excluded as the cause of the outbreak,\" said Gauden Galea, WHO's representative in China, AFP reported.\nIn response to speculation about a SARS outbreak, the Wudan police announced Wednesday (Jan. 1) that eight individuals had been punished for \"publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification,\" the AFP added.\n\"If it were SARS, we are experienced in managing it,\" Emily Chan Ying-yang, a medical professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a visiting professor at the University of Oxford, told the South China Morning Post. \"But if it is a new strain, then we should pay attention.\"\nDuring the 2002 outbreak, SARS caused many fatalities among young people, so it's important to determine whether serious cases of the virus are occurring in young or elderly individuals, she added.\nThe mystery pneumonia may also be caused by a rare virus or one that was previously unknown, Dr. Jiang Rongmeng of Beijing Ditan Hospital told the South China Morning Post.\nUnlike in the 2002 SARS outbreak, \"no apparent human-to-human transmission has been detected so far.

The United Nations agency activated its incident-management system at the country, regional and global level and is standing ready to launch a broader response if it’s needed, the WHO’s regional office in Manila said in Twitter posts Saturday.\nAs of Friday, 44 people had been diagnosed with pneumonia, the cause of which is unknown, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement. That’s up from 27 three days earlier. Eleven people are in serious condition. Some of the infected worked at a fresh seafood and produce market in the city.\n“China has extensive capacity to respond to public health events and is responding proactively and rapidly to the current incident in Wuhan –- isolating patients, tracing close contacts, cleaning up the market, and searching for the cause and for additional cases,” the WHO said.\nPathogen studies have ruled out more common respiratory diseases, including influenza, avian flu and adenovirus, Wuhan health authorities said. All the patients are being treated under quarantine, according to the commission.\nGovernments in the region have started to take precautions to prevent any possible spread of the infections. Singapore’s Ministry of Health said temperature screening will be implemented at Changi Airport for all travelers arriving from Wuhan. In Hong Kong, officials have classified the response level as “serious” -- the second-highest scale of action in its three-tier system -- with public hospitals reporting eight patients, aged from four to 50, who have been to the Chinese city and show symptoms for pneumonia.\nMarket Closed\nThe Wuhan seafood market, which has since been closed, also sold birds, pheasants, and snakes, along with organs of rabbits and other wildlife, the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy said Thursday, citing media reports.\nThat’s triggered concern about the potential jump of an unknown virus to humans -- reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which killed almost 800 people about 17 years ago. The Wuhan Institute of Virology didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment on the infectious source.\nIt’s not known whether a SARS-like “coronavirus” has been identified, although there have been “numerous unsubstantiated reports mentioning a novel coronavirus that is SARS-like,” the International Society for Infectious Diseases’ ProMED-mail program said in an email Friday.\nSeveral people were arrested for circulating fake news online about the viral spread of pneumonia, provincial authorities said, adding that rumors on social media alleging that there had been an outbreak of SARS are untrue, and no person-to-person transmission has been found so far.\nSingapore has asked doctors to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who have recently returned from Wuhan.\n“Suspect cases with fever and acute respiratory illness or pneumonia and with travel history to Wuhan within 14 days before onset of symptoms will be isolated as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission,” the city-state’s Ministry of Health said in a Facebook post.\nHong Kong authorities said thermal-imaging systems will be deployed as part of increased fever surveillance at boundary check points. In Taiwan, the government has also implemented measures to prevent the spread of infections, its Centers for Disease Control said Tuesday.\n(Adds measures taken by neighboring countries from the sixth paragraph.)\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jason Gale in Melbourne at j.gale@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Stanley James, Karthikeyan Sundaram\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n©2020 Bloomberg L.P.", "external_links": ["https://bloomberg.com", "https://www.bloomberg.com&quot;", "https://bloomberg.com&quot;", "https://www.bloomberg.com"], "published": "2020-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-04T11:09:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

CCTV / AFP\nBEIJING — China believes a mysterious pneumonia outbreak that has struck 59 people is due to a new strain of virus from the family of pathogens that includes SARS, state media said Thursday.\nThe infection was first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of over 11 million, and initially sparked fears about a resurgence of the highly contagious flu-like SARS. ADVERTISEMENT\nIt has also prompted authorities in Hong Kong – badly hit by SARS in 2002-2003 – to take precautionary measures, including stepping up the disinfection of trains and airplanes, including checks of passengers.\nAn expert team has “preliminarily determined” that a new type of coronavirus is behind the outbreak, lead scientist Xu Jianguo told the official Xinhua news agency. FEATURED STORIES Indonesia president visits islands also claimed by China\n“A total of 15 positive results of the new type of coronavirus had been detected” in the lab, through tests on infected blood samples and throat swabs, Xu said.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement Wednesday that a new coronavirus could not be excluded as a possible cause of the disease.\nXu said further research was needed on the nature of the outbreak.\nChina ruled out SARS, which killed hundreds of people more than a decade ago, in a statement on Sunday.\nWuhan’s health commission said on Sunday seven of the 59 patients were seriously ill but none had died. All patients received treatment in quarantine.\nEight patients have recovered and were discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, according to Xinhua.\nNo patients are known to have died so far. ADVERTISEMENT\nThe commission said the infection broke out between December 12 and 29, with some of the patients employed at a seafood market in the city that has since been closed for disinfection.\nNo obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found so far, according to the commission’s statement on Sunday.\nFootage from January 1 by state broadcaster CCTV showed an official notice at the market saying it had been closed in light of the “current pneumonia situation in our city,” without providing a date for reopening.\nThe outbreak comes just a few weeks before China’s busiest annual travel period when millions of people take buses, trains, and planes for Lunar New Year.\nChina’s Ministry of Transport has “made arrangements for disinfection, monitoring, and prevention” focusing on areas with large numbers of passengers, including stations and cargo hubs, the ministry’s chief engineer Wang Yang said at an annual press briefing Thursday.\nThe country’s civil aviation authority and national railway said at the briefing they had not received any reports of affected patients taking flights or trains, and that they were closely watching the situation.\nWan Xiangdong, chief flight officer of China’s Civil Aviation Administration, said all planes were equipped with emergency medical kits. Hong Kong, Taiwan fears\nIn Hong Kong, hospitals have raised their alert level to “serious” and stepped up detection measures including temperature checkpoints for inbound travelers.\nAuthorities in the financial hub say 38 people have been hospitalized after returning from Wuhan in recent days and displaying flu-like illnesses, but none were confirmed to have contracted the mystery new strain.\nTwenty-one of the 38 patients have been discharged, Hong Kong officials said Wednesday.\nCity residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week.\nInbound trains and flights from the mainland are undergoing additional cleaning and disinfection, Hong Kong transport authorities said.\nAdditional thermal imaging systems have been set up at the city’s airport, while inbound high-speed rail passengers from the mainland face checks by hand-held infrared thermometers.\nThe upcoming holiday has prompted concerns in Taiwan, where top officials urged the island’s health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls at airports and plan accordingly.\nOn Monday, the country’s center for disease control also advised residents planning to travel to or near Wuhan to wear masks and avoid contact with wild animals.\nThe US embassy in China warned on Tuesday that Americans traveling in the country should avoid animals and contact with sick people.

Meanwhile, 16 Hong Kong people who recently visited Wuhan, aged 2 to 55, are believed to have been infected after developing symptoms of the little-understood virus days after their return.\nHeadline Daily reports that 10 of the Hong Kong patients have tested positive for influenza, enterovirus, and coronavirus, while the other six are awaiting test results. All are currently in stable condition .\nThough the exact nature of the disease is still unknown, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has been ruled out as the culprit. However, the virus shares common features of the early stages of SARS, which are characterized by common flu symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and headaches.\nAuthorities are encouraging people to exercise caution by frequently washing hands and wearing a face mask to prevent the potential spread of the disease.\nAccording to RTHK, multiple cases of the pneumonia strain have been linked to the area of the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. Authorities have responded by closing the market and conducting measures to improve hygiene, and workers wearing protective clothing have collected samples around the area.\nA senior lecturer of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong has cautioned that even if the virus is related to the wet market, it is still not appropriate to conclude that the disease cannot be transmitted from person to person.\nChinese University of Hong Kong respiratory studies professor David Hui agreed that the suspected cases may not be directly linked with the market, but noted that early isolation of the suspected infections can help reduce the risk of new infections entering Hong Kong.\nFor more Hong Kong coverage, check out Coconuts HK .\n ", "external_links": ["http://hd.stheadline.com/news/daily/hk/824553/%E6%97%A5%E5%A0%B1-%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E-%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E%E5%A2%9E%E8%87%B359%E5%AE%97%E6%B8%AF%E7%96%91%E4%BC%BC%E5%80%8B%E6%A1%88%E5%A4%9A%E5%85%AB%E5%AE%97", "https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1500550-20200101.htm", "https://www.hk01.com/%E8%A6%AA%E5%AD%90/418042/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E5%8C%97%E5%8D%80%E5%AD%B8%E6%A0%A1%E5%8A%A0%E5%BC%B7%E8%A1%9B%E7%94%9F%E6%8E%AA%E6%96%BD-%E6%9B%BE%E5%8E%BB%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%B8%E7%94%9F%E9%9C%80%E9%9A%94%E9%9B%A27%E6%97%A5", "https://hk01.com/%E8%A6%AA%E5%AD%90/418042/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E5%8C%97%E5%8D%80%E5%AD%B8%E6%A0%A1%E5%8A%A0%E5%BC%B7%E8%A1%9B%E7%94%9F%E6%8E%AA%E6%96%BD-%E6%9B%BE%E5%8E%BB%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%B8%E7%94%9F%E9%9C%80%E9%9A%94%E9%9B%A27%E6%97%A5?itm_source=universal_search&itm_campaign=universal_search&itm_content=all&itm_medium=web", "https://webplayer.whooshkaa.com/show/7833", "https://webplayer.whooshkaa.com/show/7833?theme=light&visual=true&button-color=%2318CC36&waveform-base-color=%2318CC36&scrolling-title=true?theme=light&visual=true&button-color=%2318CC36&waveform-base-color=%2318CC36&scrolling-title=true", "https://www.servedby.adsfactor.net/adj.php?ts=1578311764&sid=816683098025", "https://www.news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1500550-20200101.htm", "http://www.hd.stheadline.com/news/daily/hk/824553/%E6%97%A5%E5%A0%B1-%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E-%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E%E5%A2%9E%E8%87%B359%E5%AE%97%E6%B8%AF%E7%96%91%E4%BC%BC%E5%80%8B%E6%A1%88%E5%A4%9A%E5%85%AB%E5%AE%97", "https://servedby.adsfactor.net/adj.php", "https://www.hk01.com/%E8%A6%AA%E5%AD%90/418042/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E5%8C%97%E5%8D%80%E5%AD%B8%E6%A0%A1%E5%8A%A0%E5%BC%B7%E8%A1%9B%E7%94%9F%E6%8E%AA%E6%96%BD-%E6%9B%BE%E5%8E%BB%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%B8%E7%94%9F%E9%9C%80%E9%9A%94%E9%9B%A27%E6%97%A5?itm_source=universal_search&itm_campaign=universal_search&itm_content=all&itm_medium=web", "https://www.webplayer.whooshkaa.com/show/7833?theme=light&visual=true&button-color=%2318CC36&waveform-base-color=%2318CC36&scrolling-title=true?theme=light&visual=true&button-color=%2318CC36&waveform-base-color=%2318CC36&scrolling-title=true", "https://servedby.adsfactor.net/adj.php?ts=1578311764&sid=816683098025"], "published": "2020-01-06T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-06T16:17:47.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

All patients are being treated in quarantine and no deaths have been reported.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), symptoms of the pneumonia are mainly fever, with a number of patients having difficulty breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive lesions of both lungs.\nThe outbreak came to light in late December and prompted fears in China of a possible resurgence of SARS, an acute viral respiratory illness first reported in the country in 2002 that caused a pandemic that ripped through Asia.\nSARS spread to 37 countries worldwide , infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 from November, 2002 to July, 2003. The illness is brought on by a coronavirus, and symptoms include fever, cough, severe headache, dizziness and other flu-like complaints.\nAmid growing disquiet, Wuhan authorities said on Sunday they had excluded the possibility of SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and bird flu. If not SARS, then what is it?\nAccording to the Wuhan health commission, the infection broke out between December 12 and December 29, with some of the patients employed at a seafood market in the city.\nLocal media reported that the market -- which has been closed since January 1 for disinfection -- also sold other live animals, including birds, rabbits and snakes, sparking concerns that the virus might have been transmitted to humans from animals.\nProfessor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it is highly likely that the outbreak was caused by a \"brand-new viral pneumonia.\"\n\"The concern now is whether the game (sold at the market) is one of the reasons for the outbreak,\" he told CNN.\nAccording to Hui, many new pathogens have been transmitted to humans from animals. The coronavirus that causes SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of southern China, where the epidemic first broke out. And dromedary camels are considered a likely source of MERS, he said.\nAuthorities have said that there has been no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission so far, and no healthcare workers have been infected. At least 163 people who have had close contact with those infected have been placed under medical observation.\nBut there are still fears of a nationwide epidemic. The outbreak came just before the start of the busy Lunar New Year travel season, when hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to be crammed into trains, buses and planes for family reunions. Millions of Chinese are also expected to travel overseas around Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25.\nProfessor Leo Poon, a virologist at Hong Kong University and a SARS expert, said the severity of the situation to come depends on whether the pneumonia in Wuhan can be transmitted among humans.\n\"If it only transmits from animals to humans, now that the market has been shut down and sanitized, the chances for people to be infected will be low,\" he said.\nHui, from Chinese University, said the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out.\n\"Most often, respiratory viruses can be transmitted among humans. It is only a matter of how contagious it is,\" he said. Asia steps up screening\nThe current outbreak in Wuhan has put Asian governments on close watch, stepping up preventive measures such as airport temperature screening and notification requirements.\nIn Hong Kong, 21 people have been found with fever or respiratory symptoms after returning from Wuhan, according to the city's Hospital Authority. Seven of them have been discharged, and so far none of them has been linked to the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan. Travelers arriving from Wuhan are also being screened at Hong Kong airport.\nIn Singapore, travelers arriving from the Chinese city are also required to go through temperature screening, according to the Ministry of Health. Doctors have been alerted to look out for suspected cases of pneumonia among people who recently returned from there.\nIn South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a quarantine task force and warned visitors to Wuhan not to touch wild animals or poultry, or visit local markets.\nTaiwan on Sunday stepped up measures by expanding the conditions for notification of suspected cases of Wuhan pneumonia, according to government-run news agency CNA.\nThe World Health Organization said in a statement Sunday that \"there is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology.\"\nIt said it does not recommend any specific measures for travelers, and \"advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the current information available on this event.\"\nFall and winter months are traditionally prone to flu epidemics. In the United States, the current flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.\nHe said while it is impossible to predict how the flu will play out, the season so far is on track to be as severe as the 2017-18 flu season, which was the deadliest in more than four decades, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

In Hong Kong, 15 patients with symptoms of respiratory illness were being treated as of Sunday. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)\nA preliminary investigation into viral pneumonia illnesses sickening dozens of people in and around China has identified the possible cause as a new type of coronavirus, state media said Thursday.\nChinese health authorities did not immediately confirm the report from state broadcaster CCTV.\nCoronaviruses are spread through coughing or sneezing or by touching an infected person. Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition , while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n\"Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,\" Galea said in a statement, adding that it \"demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.\"\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.

Fifty nine cases of the pneumonia have been reported as of Sunday.\n\"It may take years for researchers to develop medicines and vaccines,\" the Xinhua report said.\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be traveling to their home towns or abroad.

And a Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said.\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and the illness spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but none have been reported since 2004. The new illnesses had raised fears of a SARS recurrence.\nAnother coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. That outbreak started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.

While the United Nations health agency said it needed more comprehensive information to confirm precisely the type of pathogen causing the infections, it said a new coronavirus was a possibility.\nBut on Thursday, Chinese state television was more conclusive, citing pathogen test results from a preliminary assessment expert group.\n“As of January 7, 2020, the laboratory detected a new type of coronavirus,” China Central Television (CCTV) said in a report. “The new coronavirus that caused this epidemic situation is different from previously discovered human coronaviruses, and further understanding of the virus requires more scientific research.”\nThe CCTV report did not identify the laboratory or the expert group.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

They also call for calm, reminding the public that strain seems to be less lethal than Sars. Hong Kong has requested that mainland China provide genetic information on the mystery virus behind the Wuhan pneumonia outbreak, for local experts to devise more targeted tests to identify infections. The announcement was made on Thursday after mainland authorities earlier in the day said laboratory tests had determined the disease to be of a new coronavirus strain, and that its entire genome sequence had been mapped out. Coronaviruses cause diseases varying in severity, from the common cold to the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) that killed 299 people in Hong Kong in 2003. So far, the city’s public hospitals have received a total of 48 patients with fever and respiratory symptoms of pneumonia after returning from Wuhan, though 25 have been cleared and discharged. In the 24 hours till noon on Thursday, 10 suspected cases were reported, including that of an 11-month-old girl and a man, 66. “The Department of Health has contacted the National Health Commission … to ask if they can give us the genetic sequencing of the novel coronavirus so that we can have more targeted and accurate tests for suspected patients,” said Wong Ka-hing, controller of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP). According to Professor Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong, who spoke in the same press conference as Wong, there were existing tests locally that could identify patients with the Wuhan strain, even if the city did not have its genetic sequence. What we know about the new virus and how you can stop yourself getting sick But with the additional information, the diagnostic time could be cut from the current six to eight hours, to only two to three hours, Yuen said. He added that existing drugs used to fight Sars and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) were thought to be effective in combating the Wuhan strain, as he suspected that it belonged to the same subgroup of the two. But he said he could not be sure until after clinical testing on such drugs. Sars has killed more than 700 people worldwide and Mers has caused more than 850 deaths globally since 2012. Yuen said he believed it was likely the new virus came from bats, which passed it on to game animals, and then to humans. At the same briefing, Chinese University’s Professor Hui Shu-cheong, who chairs the CHP’s scientific committee on emerging and zoonotic diseases, said there was so far no evidence that the new virus could be transmitted between humans, but it was too early to make a conclusion. Both Yuen and Hui appealed for calm as the new virus was not as powerful as Sars. Hui urged Hongkongers not to eat game meat. In a separate press conference, Professor Chen Sheng, associate dean of City University’s department of infectious diseases and public health, also said the Wuhan virus did not appear as strong as Sars, because no one had died and no medical staff had been infected.

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn’t exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it’s possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\nYanan Wang, The Associated Press ON AIR RIGHT NOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T11:57:51.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

After looking into the situation, Chinese officials have now discovered 59 cases of the virus, with seven patients critically ill.\nIn response to the mysterious outbreak, neighboring countries are taking precautions . Among others, both Hong Kong and Singapore are showing extra caution with people from Wuhan city.\nHong Kong has been careful of who they let through their borders and keeping reporters in the loop of any cases in China. Taiwan’s Center for Disease Control has also taken precautions during the outbreak in Wuhan by keeping people up to date on what’s happening. Is it a SARS Outbreak?\nInitial worries from the outbreak were that it was somehow related to SARS. Also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS is both very contagious and deadly.\nThe virus, along with the related MERS , already caused some panic this century.\nIn 2002 and 2003 a SARS outbreak caused more than 700 deaths around the globe. Researchers found that outbreak of SARS began in China.\nOn January 3, 2020, the Wuhan Health Commission looked into how the outbreak occurred. Common illnesses like influenza, avian influenza, and respiratory conditions were taken out of the equation. By January 5, health officials ruled out the risk of SARS , but still lacked any more answers about the virus. What Virus Caused the Outbreak?\nThe commission discovered there was no movement of the disease from one person to another.\nSome infected individuals were found to work at Huanan seafood market, which resulted in Chinese forces to cleanse the market. The South China Morning Post reported animals sold at the market brought about the fear of people believing this unknown virus could affect them.\nThe commission also informed the public that patients have been detained. The people who came into contact with confirmed patients are also being watched over medically.\nA representative of the World Health Organization worked with the Chinese government to keep on track with this outbreak. The WHO representative says SARS is not that common. They added that officials are still looking into other explanations for viral pneumonia.\nOn Wednesday, January 8, the Wall Street Journal reported that scientists determined the illness is a new coronavirus. Although this particular virus appears to be new, it does come from the same family as SARS.\nCoronaviruses can be severe, but many prove to be mild. The common cold along with many other respiratory infections belong to the same family of viruses.\nWhile the WHO confirmed the news , Chinese officials have yet to say this new virus is behind the outbreak. The investigation into the outbreak in China is still ongoing. The History of Similar Viruses in China\nAs we wait for more official news on this outbreak, the epidemic remains similar to others in the past.\nSpecifically, the SARS outbreak which occurred 18 years ago.\nChina was blamed by the WHO for not reporting the amount of SARS cases located in a province in southern China. While it only lasted from 2002-2003, over 8,000 people located across 26 countries came into contact with the disease. In China, 349 people died due to the virus, along with 299 who died in Hong Kong.\nInternational travel was theorized to be the reason for the outbreak’s spread. SARS transmits quickly when treatment is not sought out immediately. Much like the recent Ebola outbreaks , travelers could unwittingly bring the virus to a new location during the SARS outbreak.\nAdditional blame for the outbreak was placed on Zhang Wenkang, China’s health minister at the time. Wenkang was eventually fired from his position after the outbreak ended.\nHad you heard of China’s mysterious outbreak?

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T12:39:49.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

A preliminary investigation into viral pneumonia ... more Photo: Andy Wong, AP AP Explains: The virus behind China's pneumonia outbreak 1 / 1 Back to Gallery BEIJING (AP) — Since late last year, people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have been infected with a viral pneumonia whose cause was unknown. The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion.

Preliminary tests indicated the illness may be caused by a new coronavirus, lead scientist Xu Jianguo told the official Xinhua news agency. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had also said a coronavirus could be to blame for the outbreak. So far, 59 cases have been reported, seven of which are considered critical. Mr Xu, who is leading efforts to identify the cause, said they had found the “new type” of coronavirus by testing infected blood samples and throat swabs collected from 15 people. The coronavirus can cause anything from the common cold to much more severe diseases. Notably, it caused an epidemic of the potentially deadly, flu-like Sars virus back in 2002-3, which killed more than 700 people around the world after originating in China. However, Gauden Galea, the WHO representative to China, said “further investigations” were required to “determine the source, modes of transmission, the extent of infection and countermeasures implemented”.

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said in a statement, adding that it “demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.”\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\n___\nStobbe reported from New York.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.embeds.nerdwallet.com/embed.js", "https://embeds.nerdwallet.com/embed.js"], "published": "2020-01-09T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T14:54:25.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Authorities have surprisingly demonstrated a greater level of transparency regarding the outbreak then they did with Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that emerged in 2003 and spread to 37 nations including Canada. There were more than 8,000 diagnosed cases of SARS with an approximately ten percent fatality rate over the period November 2002 through July 2003. SARS and a similar condition, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are caused by coronaviruses but have different animal reservoirs.\nPublic health researchers in China have eliminated SARS and MERS in addition to avian influenza as the cause of the current outbreak. It is however suspected that the infection may be due to a newly emerged coronavirus. Fortunately, at this stage the infective agent does not appear to be transmissible among humans but in all probability is a zoonosis. Many patients reported contact with a Wuhan market selling seafood and exotic mammals and reptiles that are consumed as food delicacies in China.\nIt is considered essential that health authorities identify the causal agent and define the means of transmission. January 25th marks the beginning of the Lunar New Year holiday period associated with travel involving at least 25 percent of the population in China. Although, the agent responsible for the new respiratory syndrome is not apparently transmitted among humans, circulation of the virus in a dense population may result in a mutation that increases pathogenicity and infectivity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T17:22:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

She had visited Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei Province, but told doctors that she had no contact with animals while she was there and didn't visit a seafood market where most cases have been traced to in China.\nThe KCDC also conducted nine respiratory tests including for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), influenza and the respiratory syncytial virus ― all of which were negative.\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that the Chinese health authorities had identified a new type of coronavirus as a possible cause after a preliminary assessment conducted by a team of experts there. But, the Chinese government has not yet publicly issued an official statement in that regard.\n\"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to SARS.

It also strongly recommended people to maintain good personal hygiene, and asked them to immediately seek medical attention if they feel sick after traveling there.\nejb@koreatimes.co.kr ", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-10T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-10T21:09:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Published 10 January 2020 Public Health England\nPublic Health England ( PHE ) is monitoring the situation with international partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO). PHE has also issued advice to travellers ahead of Chinese New Year this month.\nThe risk to the UK population is very low and the risk to travellers to Wuhan is low, but they are advised to take simple precautions such as practicing good hand and personal hygiene.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has reported 59 cases of the disease so far, the majority of which appear to be connected to a seafood market in the city. There have been no deaths reported and there is no evidence of transmission from person to person or any signs of illness among medical and nursing staff.\nDr Nick Phin, National Infection Service Deputy Director at PHE , said on the reported Wuhan novel coronavirus:\nBased on the available evidence, the risk to travellers to Wuhan from this disease is low and we are not advising them to change their plans.\nIn order to minimise the risk of transmission, people travelling to the area should maintain good hand and personal hygiene. Travellers should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, informing their health service prior to their attendance about their recent travel to the city. The risk to the UK population is very low. The UK has robust arrangements to manage emerging diseases and we can draw on our experience of developing pioneering diagnostic tests in humans for the coronaviruses - SARS and MERS .\nBesides the evolving situation in Wuhan, all travellers should also be aware of the risk of avian flu when visiting China during the Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, beginning on 25 January 2020.\nHuman cases of avian influenza have recently been reported in China, and historically there have been more cases at this time of year. Cases have originated from several provinces and municipalities across mainland China, and there have been a small number of avian influenza cases among Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan residents who have travelled to mainland China.\nThe majority of reported human cases in China have had close contact with wild birds or poultry. Although the risk is very low, Public Health England and the National Travel Health Network and Centre ( NaTHNaC ) are reminding UK travellers to protect themselves from avian flu by minimising exposure to wild birds and poultry.\nDr Phin added on avian flu:\nAlthough the risk of avian flu to UK residents travelling to China remains very low, anyone planning to visit China, Hong Kong SAR or Taiwan should minimise their exposure to any birds such as wild birds or live birds in ‘wet markets’ as a precaution.\nWe strongly urge people to avoid touching dead or dying birds and maintain good hand and personal hygiene. Avian influenza remains a risk in a number of parts of China and if travellers experience coughing or difficulty breathing within 14 days of returning from China, they should call their GP or NHS 111 and report their recent travel.\nTravellers can check NaTHNaC ’s TravelHealthPro website for current travel health recommendations for:", "external_links": ["https://travelhealthpro.org.uk", "https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/", "https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/"], "published": "2020-01-10T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T00:30:12.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan's outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown, but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina's transport ministry says it plans additional measures to disinfect trains, planes and buses and prevent transmission of diseases during the 40-day travel rush centred on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls this year on Jan. 25. The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n“The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" the ministry's chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n“In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,\" Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travellers to Wuhan. Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was quoted by the city's official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n\"So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T06:28:43.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year.

It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan’s outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown, but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina’s transport ministry says it plans additional measures to disinfect trains, planes and buses and prevent transmission of diseases during the 40-day travel rush centered on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls this year on Jan. 25. The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n“The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,” the ministry’s chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n“In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,” Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan. Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was quoted by the city’s official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n“So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.

The disease has made dozens of people sick in the city of Wuhan and at least one person has died.\nCoronavirus is a species of virus that appears crown-like under a microscope. They can cause illnesses as mundane as the common cold to ones as deadly as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) — which killed 774 people globally in 2002 and 2003 — and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) — which was identified in 2012 and has killed 851 people so far . Many coronavirus strains only transmit between animals and don’t spread to humans. Most coronaviruses spread through coughing, sneezing, or general contact with an infected person, though this doesn’t seem to be the case for the outbreak in China.\nLauren DeCicca via Getty Images A \"Health Beware Card\" handed out by officials after performing thermal scans on passengers arriving from Wuhan, China at Suvarnabumi Airport on Jan. 8, 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand. A World Health Organization (WHO) statement about the new strain suggests that while it can be quite severe for some patients, it doesn’t readily transmit between people . Preliminary lab tests have identified it as a coronavirus, but more research is needed to confirm the virus for certain and a drug or vaccine would take years to develop.\nPeople who fell sick in China all reportedly visited the same wild animal market in Wuhan, the Washington Post reported . A few people in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea who recently visited Wuhan have also shown symptoms, which include fever and lesions on the lungs that can be seen during chest radiographs.\nNOEL CELIS via Getty Images Security guards stand in front of the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei Province of China, on Jan. 11, 2020, where the Wuhan health commission said that the man who died from a respiratory illness had purchased goods. One man who died was 61 years old, and regularly visited the market that authorities have linked to the disease. The man was also previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease.\nForty-one people have been diagnosed with the new illness, according to Aljazeera, and seven are in critical condition. Two people have been discharged from the hospital. No new cases have allegedly been reported since Jan. 3. The animal market was closed on Jan. 1 for cleaning and disinfection. No health care workers have become ill from treating patients — a good sign the disease doesn’t transmit easily from human to human.\nLauren DeCicca via Getty Images Public Health officials hand out disease monitoring information after performing thermal scans on passengers arriving from Wuhan, China at Suvarnabumi Airport. The WHO did not recommend any specific restrictions or measures for travellers or trade in and out of China, but the federal government did release a travel advisory for Canadians visiting the region. Travel in and out of the country is expected to increase around the Lunar New Year holiday on Jan. 25.\nIt recommended travellers avoid high-risk areas that have animals like farms, markets and butchers, avoid contact with living and dead animals, and avoid surfaces with animal waste on them. The advisory also reminded travellers to wash their hands frequently and monitor their own health carefully during and after their trips.\nThe WHO said it is continuing to monitor the situation in China, as well as how authorities in the country respond to it.\n Sima Shakeri Associate Editor, HuffPost Canada", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-identifies-new-strain-of-coronavirus-as-source-of-pneumonia-outbreak/2020/01/09/f2625650-329f-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html", "https://washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-identifies-new-strain-of-coronavirus-as-source-of-pneumonia-outbreak/2020/01/09/f2625650-329f-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html"], "published": "2020-01-12T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-12T03:02:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

He tested positive for the virus, it added.\nThe commission added that no new cases had been detected since Jan. 3.\nThe Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at the seafood market, and that to date no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Jan. 9 that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak.\nWHO says new virus may have caused China pneumonia outbreak\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be traveling to their home towns or abroad.\nThe Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Jan. 9.\nThe Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests.\nChina's National Health Commission said in a separate statement that it would share information on the genome sequence of the coronavirus with the WHO to safeguard global health security.\nHong Kong's Department of Health also said on Jan. 11 that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border checkpoints, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced the government to reveal the epidemic.\nThe disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

The infection was first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of over 11 million\nLead scientist Xu Jianguo told the official Xinhua news agency that experts had \"preliminarily determined\" a new type of coronavirus was behind the outbreak, first confirmed on December 31 in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of over 11 million. It initially sparked fears of a resurgence of highly contagious Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and prompted authorities in Hong Kong -- badly hit by SARS in 2002-2003 -- to take precautions, including stepping up the disinfection of trains and airplanes, and checks of passengers. China has since ruled out a fresh outbreak of SARS, which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong. \"A total of 15 positive results of the new type of coronavirus had been detected\" in the lab, through tests on infected blood samples and throat swabs, Xu said. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the preliminary discovery of a new coronavirus in a statement. \"Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO Representative to China. Wuhan's health commission said on Sunday seven of the 59 patients were seriously ill, but none had died. All received treatment in quarantine. Eight patients have recovered and were discharged from hospital on Wednesday, according to Xinhua. The commission said the infection broke out between December 12 and 29, with some of the patients employed at a city seafood market since closed for disinfection. No obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission has been reported so far. Footage from January 1 by state broadcaster CCTV showed an official notice at the market saying it had been closed in light of the \"current pneumonia situation in our city\", without providing a date for reopening. The outbreak comes just a few weeks before China's busiest annual travel period, when millions of people take buses, trains and planes for Lunar New Year. A Chinese transport ministry official said at a briefing that arrangements were made for \"disinfection, monitoring and prevention\" focusing on areas with large numbers of passengers, including stations and cargo hubs. Civil aviation and national railway authorities said they had not received any reports of affected patients taking flights or trains, and that they were closely watching the situation. Wan Xiangdong, chief flight officer of China's Civil Aviation Administration, said all planes were equipped with emergency medical kits. WHO representative Galea said \"people with symptoms of pneumonia and reported travel history to Wuhan have been identified at international airports\". The organisation has not recommended any travel restrictions on China. - Hong Kong, Taiwan fears - In Hong Kong, hospitals have raised their alert level to \"serious\" and stepped up detection measures -- including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers. Authorities in the financial hub say 38 people have been hospitalised in recent days after returning from Wuhan and displaying flu-like illnesses, but none were confirmed to have contracted the mystery virus. Some 21 of the 38 patients had been discharged by Wednesday. City residents worried about the outbreak have rushed to buy face masks from local pharmacies, with many selling out earlier this week. Inbound trains and flights from the mainland are undergoing extra cleaning and disinfection, authorities said. Additional thermal imaging systems have been set up at the city's airport, while inbound high-speed rail passengers from the mainland face checks by hand-held infrared thermometers. The coming holiday has prompted concerns in Taiwan, where top officials urged the island's health and welfare ministry to strengthen quarantine controls at airports. On Monday, the country's centre for disease control also advised residents planning to travel to or near Wuhan to wear masks and avoid contact with wild animals. The US embassy in China warned on Tuesday that Americans travelling in the country should avoid animals and contact with sick people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T12:17:06.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

EcoHealth Alliance's phylogenetic analysis shows that a novel coronavirus newly spilled over into humans in China is closely related to SARS CoV (Photo: EcoHealth Alliance\nFurther analysis is necessary, but this preliminary analysis shows the virus is also quite similar to other SARS-related coronaviruses which appear to be endemic to the area.

We are also conducting behavioral analysis with the goal of reducing risk for this spillover.\nThe virus responsible for the current outbreak in Wuhan has so far killed one person; fortunately it's not currently believed that the virus has the ability to spread human-to-human.

(photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images Images)\nIn Pictures via Getty Images The latest “novel coronavirus” emerged in Wuhan, China in mid-December and was quite rapidly preliminarily identified as likely a coronavirus , a common virus group which causes respiratory tract infections. This would be the third new coronavirus causing outbreaks in the past twenty years; it’s impressive seeing the scientific progress made since SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003.\nSARS, the first widespread and deadly coronavirus, spread globally, infecting almost 8100 and killing 774 in 37 countries before it was brought under control. Cases began in November 2003, and exploded over the first three months . It took until July to stop the outbreak.\nScientists discovered the link to civets in live animal markets in China. Subsequently fruit bats were found to be the likely reservoir for the virus. At that time, China was initially reluctant to openly discuss the scope of the SARS problem. Other countries, as India and Peru, had experienced severe financial losses after epidemics were reported in their countries. Gro Harlem Brundtland, then Director general of WHO , helped gain the Chinese government’s cooperation. Greater transparency and sharing specimens and information was essential to stopping the epidemic, as were rigorous infection control precautions.\nThe next novel coronavirus was MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. A major problem in identifying and stopping that epidemic was that the Saudi government was less than forthcoming about the cases . In fact, there were solid reports that the Saudi government even directed physicians to misreport the cause of death of patients .\nProMed Mail , an infectious disease internet-based reporting system, was essential in rapidly communicating information, just as FluTrackers is now. (Both deserve more support as invaluable resources).\nMERS was found to be primarily spread person-to-person, although a small percentage of patients had direct contact with camels, likely the major reservoir. Bats were also found to be hosts for the virus. In that outbreak, 851 people died.\nFighting over patent considerations and sharing samples and information was vicious; you might want to read about virologist Ali Mohamed Zaki’s firing .\nWuhan coronavirus\nHuman coronavirus.

Viral diameter around 80-160 nm. (Photo by: BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nUniversal Images Group via Getty Images Now we have this new virus emerging in China. This has been handled more openly than before. China first reported the unusual cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019.\nInitially, 59 people were thought to be infected. Scientists were able to isolate the virus from one patient. Electron microscopy led them to recognize that the virus appeared to be a typical coronavirus with its spiky surface.\nRemarkably, scientists have already identified the genetic sequence of the virus—achieved by cooperation between university centers in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Sydney, Australia, and the Chinese CDC. They are also sharing the sequencing to make it available to other researchers.\nSo far, they have learned that while the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak was similar to SARS in being tied to live animal markets and the virus resembles bat viruses , they are caused by different viruses.\nAs of this morning (1/11/20), genomic testing has lowered the number of confirmed cases to 41. Seven patients are severely ill with pneumonia, one has died, and the others are stable. No human-to-human transmission has been detected.\nWhat happens next?\nEpidemiologic work will need to continue, monitoring close contacts of cases to look for new secondary cases. We still don’t know the source of the disease or how it was transmitted—though a mammal at the live meat market seems the most likely route. Marion Koopmans, DVM, PhD, an expert on zoonoses (animal related infections) at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, asks a key question:\n\" What happened at that market that led to infection of so many people at the same time? And is that source contained—with the closing and cleaning of the market?\"\nWill the virus be found at other similar markets? What was different at this one in Wuhan? The reservoir of infection needs to be identified; it is suspected to be bats because of the similarities in the virus to SARS and MERS, though there are significant differences.\nAntibody tests will need to be developed to screen for cases of infection that were asymptomatic.\nThe disease will need to be replicated in lab animals to better study how it is transmitted and how it causes illness.\nWhile there has not yet been person-to-person spread demonstrated, surveillance will be tested when up to 400 million Chinese travel during the upcoming Lunar New Year.\nAnother thing that is different with this outbreak is that there has been much greater vigilance. Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea preemptively screened and isolated travelers from Wuhan and have found no spread. Symptomatic patients were found to have other viral infections.\nThere is reason for such caution. In 2003, SARS claimed 299 lives in Hong Kong alone. It’s no surprise that Hong Kong wants to make this new respiratory infection a statutory notifiable infectious disease , meaning suspected cases would have to be reported to public health authorities.\nIt turns out that the Pandemic Preparedness Exercise at Johns Hopkins University last month was quite timely. It used a fictional “novel coronavirus” as a case study modeled after MERS and SARS. Event 201 is available to watch . Emily Ricotta, PhD ( @Iplaywithgerms ) also live-tweeted it and her thread can be seen here . That is a more efficient way of seeing what happened, as well as being perhaps less depressing. My post also summarizes the group’s recommendations . The expertise of the participants was impressive. One of them was George Gao, Director-General of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). A full list is available here .\nThis new “Wuhan virus” outbreak in China, which appears to be due to a novel coronavirus, is another warning to us about the need for more research in infectious diseases, epidemiology and control measures. Close contact with live animals is a common thread, as is habitat destruction (e.g. Ebola). We are lucky so far, but there is much we still don’t know about this new virus.", "external_links": ["http://cdc.gov/about/history/sars/feature.htm", "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/opinion/global/how-sars-was-contained.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/feature.htm", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/symptoms.html", "https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars?search=SARS&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~23&usage_type=default&display_rank=1#H4", "https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/symptoms.html", "https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/mystery-virus-found-wuhan-resembles-bat-viruses-not-sars-chinese-scientist-says", "https://washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-identifies-new-strain-of-coronavirus-as-source-of-pneumonia-outbreak/2020/01/09/f2625650-329f-11ea-", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-virus-discovered-by-chinese-scientists-investigating-pneumonia-outbreak-11578485668", "https://flutrackers.com/forum/", "http://www.wired.com/2013/08/ap_mers/", "http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php", "https://www.flutrackers.com/forum/", "http://centerforhealthsecurity.org/newsroom/center-news/2019/2019-10-15-event201.html", "http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html&nbsp;", "https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-other-health-threats/china-emerging-diseases-other-health-threats/821830-china-41-diagnosed-viral-pneumonia-coronavirus-cases-in-wuhan-hubei-province-december-30-2019-1-fatal-case-739-screened-so-far-including-419-hcw?view=stream", "https://flutrackers.com/forum", "https://twitter.com/Iplaywithgerms", "https://cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/01/more-details-emerge-new-coronavirus-wuhan-cluster", "https://promedmail.org", "http://www.crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2014/05/linking-mers-between-saudi-arabia-and-the-us.html", "http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?p=489135", "http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/newsroom/center-news/2019/2019-10-15-event201.html", "https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/scientists-urge-china-quickly-share-data-virus-linked-pneumonia-outbreak", "https://wsj.com/articles/new-virus-discovered-by-chinese-scientists-investigating-pneumonia-outbreak-11578485668", "https://www.threadreaderapp.com/thread/1185177627117666309.html", "http://www.wired.com/2013/08/ap_mers", "https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars", "http://who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html&nbsp;", "http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201", "https://promedmail.org/", "https://www.promedmail.org/", "http://wired.com/2013/08/ap_mers/", "https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/01/more-details-emerge-new-coronavirus-wuhan-cluster", "https://sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/mystery-virus-found-wuhan-resembles-bat-viruses-not-sars-chinese-scientist-says", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-identifies-new-strain-of-coronavirus-as-source-of-pneumonia-outbreak/2020/01/09/f2625650-329f-11ea-", "https://www.flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-other-health-threats/china-emerging-diseases-other-health-threats/821830-china-41-diagnosed-viral-pneumonia-coronavirus-cases-in-wuhan-hubei-province-december-30-2019-1-fatal-case-739-screened-so-far-including-419-hcw?view=stream", "https://uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars?search=SARS&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~23&usage_type=default&display_rank=1#H4", "http://centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/", "https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1185177627117666309.html", "http://flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?p=489135", "https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-other-health-threats/china-emerging-diseases-other-health-threats/821830-china-41-diagnosed-viral-pneumonia-coronavirus-cases-in-wuhan-hubei-province-december-30-2019-1-fatal-case-739-screened-so-far-including-419-hcw", "http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2014/05/linking-mers-between-saudi-arabia-and-the-us.html", "http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/", "https://sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/scientists-urge-china-quickly-share-data-virus-linked-pneumonia-outbreak", "https://nytimes.com/2013/03/15/opinion/global/how-sars-was-contained.html", "https://www.twitter.com/Iplaywithgerms"], "published": "2020-01-11T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T18:48:16.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat. Experts think those infected probably touched or ate animals carrying the virus. They then developed symptoms including fever, breathing issues and lesions on their lungs.\nThe coronavirus family includes six other strains known to infect humans. All of them share a signature look under a strong microscope: a circle with spikes coming off the surface, ending with small blobs — hence the \"corona.\"\n\"Kind of looks like the peaks of a crown,\" says Carolyn Machamer , a virologist and cell biologist at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nFour of those strains cause common colds, and two — SARS and MERS — have caused major pandemics. So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

He tested positive for the virus, it added.\nThe commission added that no new cases had been detected since Jan. 3.\nThe Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at the seafood market, and that to date no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Jan. 9 that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be traveling to their home towns or abroad.\nThe Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Jan. 9.\nThe Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests.\nChina's National Health Commission said in a separate statement that it would share information on the genome sequence of the coronavirus with the WHO to safeguard global health security.\nHong Kong's Department of Health also said on Jan. 11 that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border checkpoints, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced the government to reveal the epidemic.\nThe disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries.

Seven severe cases have been reported, but no deaths. No cases have been reported outside of Wuhan. According to Chinese authorities, no human to human transmission could be documented.\nEpidemiological investigations including contact tracing activities are ongoing and hygiene- and environmental sanitation activities in the affected market have been carried out in Wuhan.\nThree EU airports have direct flight connections to Wuhan and there are indirect flight connections to other EU hubs. Considering there is no indication of human-to-human transmission and no cases detected outside of China, the likelihood of introduction to the EU is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded. However, more epidemiological and laboratory information is needed in order to elaborate a comprehensive assessment of this event and the possible risk for the international spread.\nECDC is monitoring this event through epidemic intelligence activities.

The outbreak raised the spectre of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 people with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some cause the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nThe name comes from the Latin word “corona,” meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under a microscope.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person, but officials said the present illness does not not transmit readily between people\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market, meaning it's possible they were infected by animals there. The market is being suspended and investigated.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus causes MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination through gene sequencing of the virus from one patient, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n“Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,” Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct more research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\nThe Canadian Press.

Health officials think it's the likely culprit in a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been diagnosed with mysterious viral lung infections since early December.\nChinese researchers say they sequenced the new coronavirus's genome from one patient's samples, and matched it to fourteen other people in the outbreak.\nThe cases appear to be linked to a large seafood market in the city, which also sold live animals for meat.

So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

According to a statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on Friday, the 61-year-old man was hospitalized with severe pneumonia while suffering from an abdominal tumour and chronic liver disease, although the cause of death was declared to be respiratory and circulatory failure, reports Efe news. After the completion of lab tests, a total of 41 cases of this mysterious viral pneumonia have been diagnosed. Two of these patients have been discharged, another seven are in serious condition and one has died. The rest of the patients were stable and no new cases have been detected among the 739 people who have been in contact with the patients, including 419 members of the medical teams. According to the commission, no more infections have been detected over the last three days and there is no evidence that there has been any further contagion between humans. The outbreak has sparked a health panic in China since the pathogen causing it and its origin were unknown. For many, the situation was reminiscent of 2003, when SARS spread across the country and caused a total of 646 deaths (813 worldwide), according to figures from the World Health Organization. According to the WHO, between 14 and 15 per cent of SARS cases end in death, while in the case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a related disease also caused by a coronavirus, the mortality rate shoots up to 35 per cent. The symptoms described for Wuhan pneumonia so far are fever and fatigue, accompanied by dry cough and, in many cases, dyspnea (shortness of breath). The investigation suggests that the current outbreak originated at a fish and seafood market in the city which has been shut down by the authorities. –IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T06:20:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

So how concerned should you be about this new disease?\nVirologists watching the outbreak are asking three main questions to assess the severity of this coronavirus, on the scale of sniffles to severe threat:\n1) Is it contagious?\nChinese authorities say the virus does not transmit easily between people.\nSince health workers treating patients don't seem to have gotten sick, it's reasonable to believe that the virus doesn't spread efficiently, says Vineet Menachery , a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

The man, the first victim of the outbreak that began in December, was a regular buyer at the seafood market, who had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease, the health authority said.\nTreatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of January 9 when his heart failed.\nThe commission added that no new cases had been detected since January 3.\nThe Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at a seafood market in the city, and that to date no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found.\nThe World Health Organisation said that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.\nGenetic sequence decoded Chinese medical workers have obtained the virus' genetic sequence, a major step forward in curbing an epidemic outbreak, an expert said.\nWang Guangfa, a leading respiratory physician with the Peking University First Hospital, said in an interview with China Central Television (CCTV) that preliminary research completed by medical workers showed that the disease is related to a new type of coronavirus.\nIn addition, medical experts have obtained the genetic sequence of the previously unknown virus, meaning they are now one step closer in disclosing the cause of the recent rise in viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, said Wang.\n\"Because when we have this virus' [genetic] sequence, we can design the PCR kit, then we will be able to carry out clinic diagnosis. I think we have done pretty good on that,\" he said.\n\"It's largely under control.

That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan's outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown, but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina's transport ministry says it plans additional measures to disinfect trains, planes and buses and prevent transmission of diseases during the 40-day travel rush centered on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls this year on Jan. 25. The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n“The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" the ministry's chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n“In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,\" Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan. Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was quoted by the city's official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n\"So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T08:38:18.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan's outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown, but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina's transport ministry says it plans additional measures to disinfect trains, planes and buses and prevent transmission of diseases during the 40-day travel rush centred on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls this year on Jan. 25. The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n“The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" the ministry's chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n“In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,\" Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travellers to Wuhan. Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was quoted by the city's official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n\"So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T07:01:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Reuters | January 11, 2020, 18:30 IST Newsletter A A By Brenda GohSHANGHAI, - A 61-year-old man has died from pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan after an outbreak of a yet to be identified virus while seven others are in critical condition, the Wuhan health authorities said on Saturday.In total, 41 people have been diagnosed with the pathogen, which preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media earlier this week pointed to a new type of coronavirus , the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement on its website.Two of them have been discharged from hospital and the rest are in stable condition, while 739 people deemed to have been in close contact with the patients have been cleared, it said.The man, the first victim of the outbreak that began in December, was a regular buyer at a seafood market in the city, who had been previously diagnosed with abdominal tumours and chronic liver disease , the health authority said.Treatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of Jan. 9 when his heart failed. He tested positive for the virus, it added.The commission added that no new cases had been detected since Jan. 3.The Wuhan health authority also said that the patients were mainly vendors and purchasers at the seafood market, and that to date no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found.The World Health Organization said on Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, could be the cause of the present outbreak.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes MERS, are far more severe.The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China 's 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440 million trips via rail and another 79 million trips via airplanes, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.The Wuhan health authority in its statement also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases, and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen and as of Friday had completed nucleic acid tests.Hong Kong's Department of Health said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border check points, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station which receives passengers from Wuhan city.In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.

It was closed on January 1.\nThere is so far no indication of human-to-human transmission of the virus.\n‘Not unexpected’\nScientists in Hong Kong’s Department of Health said on Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus from a Wuhan patient, published online by a Chinese expert, indicated it was 80 percent similar to SARS found in bats.\nWHO said on Monday it was not surprising that the virus had spread beyond China.\n“The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected and reinforces why WHO calls for ongoing active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,” it said in a statement.\nThai authorities have been on high alert, with airport officials checking all passengers coming from Wuhan to the kingdom’s major airports.\nAn official from the Public Health Emergency Operation Center told AFP the infected woman traveling from Wuhan had been intercepted on arrival in Thailand after airport officials determined she had a fever.\nWHO said it had issued guidance on how to detect and treat people with the new virus and stressed that China’s decision to rapidly share the genetic sequencing of the virus made it possible to quickly diagnose patients.\nWHO has not recommended any specific measures for travelers or restrictions on trade with China, but stressed on Monday it was taking the situation seriously.\n“Given developments, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will consult with Emergency Committee members and could call for a meeting of the committee on short notice,” it said in a statement.\nDuring such meetings, experts determine whether the UN health agency should declare an international health emergency — a designation used only for the gravest epidemics.\n© Agence France-Presse", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "published": "2020-01-14T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-14T11:13:29.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Reduce your risk of #coronavirus infection: pic.twitter.com/ZwyFVwY6EU — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 13, 2020\nIn its statement, WHO identified the patient as a traveller from Wuhan, in China, who was hospitalized in Thailand on 8 January. According to Thai authorities, the patient is recovering from the illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, infecting dozens of people in China and, on Saturday, Chinese media reported the first known death from the virus.\nCoronaviruses rely on animal to human transmission, and the health commission in Wuhan has reportedly declared that there is no evidence of any spread between humans.\nHowever, given recent developments, WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is planning to consult with the members of the agency’s Emergency Committee, and could call for a meeting of the Committee at short notice.\nIn its Monday statement, WHO noted that it has been expecting cases to be reported in countries other than China, underscoring the importance of monitoring and preparedness in other countries. The work of WHO and the Chinese authorities in containing the new coronavirus will be made more complicated by the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, which begins on January 25, and sees hundreds of millions criss-crossing the country.\nWHO has issued guidance on how to detect and treat persons ill with the new virus: standard recommendations for halting the spread of coronaviruses include regular hand washing; covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing; thoroughly cooking meat and eggs; and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing. What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are described by WHO as “a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases”. Probably the best known is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, commonly known as SARS, which broke out in Asia in 2003, and spread to countries in North America, South America and Europe, before being successfully contained later that year.\nCoronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and there are several known coronaviruses currently circulating in animals, that have not yet infected humans.\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

AFP\nA Chinese woman traveling to Thailand from Wuhan City was confirmed to be infected with a new strain of coronavirus and treated near Bangkok in the first reported case outside China, the Thai public health minister said Monday.\nFrom Jan. 3 to 12, Thai authorities screened more than 9,000 passengers from Wuhan, the center of the mystery outbreak, Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters in Bangkok. Authorities found that a dozen of the travelers had developed flu-like symptoms while the woman was the only one diagnosed with coronavirus, he said.\n“One of them had a high temperature, according to a scanner at Suvarnabhumi Airport, and was quarantined at the Bamrasnaradura Institute on Jan. 8,” Anutin said. “The lab results showed it is the first case of the new strain of coronavirus found in Thailand and the first found outside of China.”\n“She was treated and is ready to travel back to her country. We found no more patients suffering from coronavirus,” Anutin said, adding the others suffered from seasonal flu and eight had been treated and released.\nAnutin urged the public to not panic because the patient, identified as a 61-year-old woman, was being quarantined until she returned to China.\nSeveral dozen people in China’s Wuhan City have suffered from coronavirus and one man has died, according to news reports. A meat and seafood market in the city has been closed after it was linked to the outbreak.\nChinese officials said they had not identified the cause of the outbreak and played down speculation that it could be a repeat of the coronavirus blamed for the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in 2003.\nAfter Thailand reported its first case of a person being diagnosed with the coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday it was working with Thai and Chinese officials.\n“The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,” the U.N. agency said in a statement. “WHO has issued guidance on how to detect and treat persons who are ill with the new virus. The genetic sequencing shared by China enables more countries to rapidly diagnose patients.”\nEarlier this month, WHO reported that patients who have been infected suffer from fever, shortness of breath and have an accumulation of fluid in their lungs as detected by x-rays.\nAccordign to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronaviruses are common in different species of animals, including camels and bats. In rare cases, the viruses can evolve and infect humans and then spread between humans, the agency said.

The health threat now stands at “Level III (Serious)”, meaning that the risk of threatening situations is “medium”, according to a statement from Macau’s health authority. The warning warrants the “strengthening of prevention and control measures immediately,” instructed the Health Bureau (SSM). Since the start of the year, the SSM has detected five cases of individuals with a suspected or confirmed viral infection, who had been to Wuhan City in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. However, the SSM stressed that, as of last night, Macau had not reported any cases of the Wuhan-related “pneumonia of unknown origin.” Meanwhile, Hong Kong health authorities said yesterday that the city had detected eight possible cases and activated its own “serious response” warning. At least 44 people are believed to have contracted the illness in Wuhan, an inland city west of Shanghai, with 11 cases deemed “serious.” The director of the SSM, Lei Chin Ion, said last week that although viral pneumonia is a common infection in winter, the frequency of the reports stemming from Wuhan should be considered an abnormal situation. The exact nature of the infectious disease has not been ascertained by health authorities. The outbreak, which emerged last month, has revived memories of the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic that started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in the mainland, Hong Kong and elsewhere. New preventive measures In Macau, the elevation of the threat level was decided at a meeting convened yesterday by the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Ao Ieong U, in order to evaluate the threat of the pneumonia believed to have originated in Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei Province. At the meeting, representatives of the Public Hospital Conde São Januário and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention presented the control measures currently in force, and recommended future disease monitoring mechanisms to be employed by the various governmental agencies of Macau. Among the many measures agreed at the meeting, it was noted that the security entities of the Public Security Police Force and the Unitary Police Services would render their assistance to the SSM in implementing isolation measures and improving response mechanisms when infections are detected. The Fire Services will now use a constant reporting mechanism to maintain close communication with the SSM, and make “preliminary preparations” with ambulance staff. Meanwhile, the Customs Service has installed temperature measuring equipment at two unofficial border posts and cooperated with the Municipal Affairs Bureau to strictly combat animal food smuggling at border posts and strengthen public health. The Education and Youth Affairs Bureau has implemented a notification mechanism and treatment measures and has sent letters to schools, educational institutions and tutoring rooms to call for compliance with infectious disease prevention measures. The tourism authority has pledged to strengthen contact with entities in the tourism sector and distribute updated SSM guidelines to frontline professionals so that they may better know how to deal with people who are unwell. At the same time, the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau will work to assist casinos to purchase body temperature detectors. It noted that some casinos have already purchased and installed such technology. Also agreed at yesterday’s meeting was that the Social Welfare Bureau should inspect the temperature measurement equipment of all the social facilities in Macau and carry out immediate inspections should incidents be reported. The Civil Aviation Authority will continue to assist the SSM in conducting temperature measurements for airport passengers and refining the relevant airport response protocols. Under investigation Late last week, the SSM announced it had started screening passengers on flights from Wuhan with temperature control devices. Since January 1, 2020, the Health Services have evaluated 5 people who have been in Wuhan City for the past 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Four were diagnosed with a viral infection such as influenza or the common cold. One new case, currently under investigation, involves a 44-year-old Macau resident who had traveled to Wuhan with her son between December 23 and 25 last year. On the night of January 4, she was admitted to the public hospital for medical treatment because of respiratory problems. The SSM noted that the respiratory test result was negative, but the patient will nevertheless remain in isolation until further clinical examination can be performed. At present, her state of health is considered mild and she has not presented any pneumonia or other serious conditions. The infection is also being monitored by the World Health Organization, which said it is in active communication with its counterparts in China, where an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the infection. “China has extensive capacity to respond to public health events and is responding proactively and rapidly to the current incident in Wuhan – isolating patients, tracing close contacts, cleaning up the market, and searching for the cause and for additional cases,” the WHO said.\nAn aspect of yesterday’s meeting In Wuhan, several of the infected were reported to work at a fresh seafood and produce market in the city, raising the possibility that the disease could be transmitted by animals. Pathogen studies have ruled out more common respiratory diseases, including influenza, avian flu and adenovirus, Wuhan health authorities said. The Wuhan seafood market, which has since been closed, also sold birds, pheasants, and snakes, along with organs of rabbits and other wildlife, said the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, citing media reports. The animal connection has triggered concern about the potential jump of an unknown virus to humans – reminiscent of SARS. The Wuhan Institute of Virology didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment on the infectious source. It’s not known whether a SARS- like “coronavirus” has been identified, although there have been “numerous unsubstantiated reports mentioning a novel coronavirus that is SARS-like,” the International Society for Infectious Diseases’ ProMED-mail program wrote in an email, cited by Bloomberg.

The 44 cases, up from the initial 27 announced Tuesday, include 11 \"severe cases,\" health authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan said in a statement. \"The vital signs of the other patients are generally stable,\" the statement said. The authorities are still in the process of identifying the cause of the infection, but \"influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases have been excluded,\" the Wuhan health commission said on Friday, without mentioning SARS, which is caused by a coronavirus. News of the mystery pneumonia outbreak earlier this week led to speculation online that it might be linked to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a highly contagious respiratory disease. Wuhan police on Wednesday said they had punished eight people for \"publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification.\" The health commission said all patients have received treatment in isolation and the city was tracking people who had come into close contact with the patients. Some of those being treated work in a seafood market in the city, and \"no obvious evidence of human to human transmission\" has been found so far, the commission said. The World Health Organization (WHO) criticised China for under-reporting the number of SARS cases following the outbreak in 2003. SARS killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong that year. The virus, which infected more than 8,000 people around the world, is expected to have originated in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, according to WHO. China sacked its then health minister Zhang Wenkang for the poor handling of the crisis in 2003, several months after the first case was reported. WHO announced that China was free of SARS in May 2004.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-03T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-03T23:48:01.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Some cause the common cold and others can lead to more severe respiratory diseases, such as SARS and MERS. Such viruses are common in people but more exotic versions from bats, camels and other animals have caused severe illness.\nThe novel coronavirus is different from those that have previously been identified, CCTV said. Health authorities ruled out SARS and MERS as possible causes over the weekend.\nAs of Sunday, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 59 people in the central Chinese city were being treated for the respiratory illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable.\nEight patients were discharged Wednesday, Xinhua state news agency reported. They had not exhibited any pneumonia symptoms for several days.\nChinese researchers used a sample from one patient to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n\"Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,\" Galea said in a statement, adding that it \"demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.\"\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travellers to Wuhan.\nSince the end of 2019, Hong Kong public hospitals have reported 38 patients who presented with fever, respiratory infection or pneumonia symptoms after recent visits to Wuhan. Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients worked. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother coronavirus causes MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently travelled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised US travellers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word 'corona,' meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it's possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n'Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,' Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T14:04:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The new illnesses had raised fears of a SARS recurrence.\nAnother coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.

The outbreak raised the specter of another SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nA preliminary investigation has now identified the respiratory disease as a new type of coronavirus, Chinese state media reported Thursday, citing scientists handling the investigation.\nAs of Sunday, local authorities reported 59 patients with the illness. Seven were in critical condition, while the rest were stable. Eight were discharged Wednesday night after they didn't exhibit any more symptoms for several days.\nWHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES?\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that was first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. Some are a cause of the common cold, while others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS.\nThe family derives its name from the Latin word 'corona,' meaning a halo or crown, which the viruses resemble when viewed under an electron microscope.\nHOW ARE CORONAVIRUSES SPREAD AND WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCoronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Common symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said some of the infected patients ran businesses in a seafood market that is being suspended and investigated. As the present illness does not not transmit readily between people, it's possible they were infected by animals at the market.\nIS IT ANYTHING LIKE SARS?\nWhile SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, also belongs to the coronavirus family, Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens.\nSARS emerged as a novel coronavirus in 2002, first infecting people in southern China, then spreading to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and more than 700 died. No new cases have been reported since 2004.\nAnother form of coronavirus has caused MERS, an illness that began in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 before spreading to about two dozen other countries. It has resulted in more than 800 deaths, with the majority reported from Saudi Arabia.\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\nChinese researchers made their preliminary determination by using an isolate from one positive patient sample to conduct gene sequencing of the virus, according to a statement from Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative to China.\n'Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement,' Galea said.\nBut more must be done before scientists can reach a definitive conclusion. Xu Jianguo, the leader of the expert group that made the preliminary assessment, told Xinhua state news agency that they will conduct pathogenic and epidemiological research over the next several weeks to confirm that it is indeed a new coronavirus.\n___\nAP Medical Writer Mike Stobbe in New York and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

Twenty-one of those patients have since been discharged, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said Wednesday.\nNo serious cases have been found to be related to those in Wuhan, said Hong Kong health chief Sophia Chan.\nNone of the Hong Kong patients had visited the seafood market in Wuhan where some of the mainland Chinese patients operated businesses. The South China Seafood City food market will be suspended and investigated, Wuhan's health commission said.\nA Chinese woman who works for a South Korean company was diagnosed Tuesday with pneumonia, according to the Korea Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said. Meanwhile, Taiwan authorities said Wednesday that they were quarantining a patient who fell ill with flu symptoms on Jan. 6, more than two weeks after the individual returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThe new illnesses had raised fears of a recurrence of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease first infected people in southern China in late 2002, and spread to more than two dozen countries. More than 8,000 people were sickened and nearly 800 died, but no cases have been reported since 2004.\n Another coronavirus caused MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. That outbreak started in Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread into about two dozen other countries. About 2,500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported, including more than 800 deaths, with cases continuing to be seen in recent years.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a health alert advising physicians who treat patients with pneumonia-like illness to consider a possible link to the Chinese outbreak and to wear masks and take other precautions in treating patients who recently traveled to Wuhan.\nThe CDC this week also advised U.S. travelers going to Wuhan to avoid animals and sick people and wash their hands often.\n___\nStobbe reported from New York.\n0 Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-09T03:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-09T04:56:55.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

Still, it's too early to conclude that this new coronavirus doesn't spread between people at all.\nHow easily a virus spreads among people depends on several factors, such as how well it replicates in a person, and where in the body the infection is located.\n\"If it's in the nose or the upper airways, it potentially could be breathed or coughed out easier,\" compared with a deeper lung infection, says Matthew Frieman , a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nThe SARS virus spread readily through close person-to-person contact. The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan's outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown, but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina's transport ministry says it plans additional measures to disinfect trains, planes and buses and prevent transmission of diseases during the 40-day travel rush centered on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls this year on Jan. 25. The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n“The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" the ministry's chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n“In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,\" Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan. Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was Quote: d by the city's official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n\"So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T07:48:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

The SARS pandemic originated in southern China in 2002, infected more than 8,000 people globally and caused some 800 deaths before the outbreak ended the following year. MERS , which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, appears to spread less easily between people, but to be more lethal. To date, it's infected around 2,500 people and caused around 850 deaths.\n2) Is it lethal?\nAs of this week , Chinese health authorities have reported seven critical cases, but no deaths from the virus. Some patients have been treated and discharged.\nThe fact that people seem able to fight off the infection and recover is a good sign, says Machamer, at Johns Hopkins.\n\"It's a serious-enough infection, but not like SARS or MERS,\" she says.\nHealth authorities are monitoring the patients in Wuhan and their close contacts to help manage the outbreak.\n3) Is it contained?\nEarlier this month, authorities closed the seafood and live animal market linked to the pneumonia cases for cleaning and investigations. It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

It's a step from the post-SARS playbook on containing outbreaks.\n\"Viruses that emerge from animals need some time to become an epidemic strain,\" says Menachery. \"The faster you find them, the faster you limit the spread.\"\nHe says that closing live markets in China and implementing strict quarantine procedures helped end the SARS outbreak globally.\nStill, until the source of the infection is found, there's no guarantee that the problem has been contained. No new cases have been reported since January 5, but Machamer says it's possible that animals from the same infected population have been sold at other live markets. According to the WHO , Chinese authorities are currently investigating the cause and monitoring for additional cases.\nOn the \"scared or not scared\" scale, Frieman says his concern level for this outbreak is at a 3 out of 10. All signs point to a nonlethal infection that doesn't spread easily between people. But if the number of cases increase, or people start dying, he'll get more worried. And if the virus shows signs of mutating to become easily transmitted between people, he says virologists will become very concerned — that's a historic warning sign for pandemics.

The Associated Press BEIJING -- Health authorities in a central Chinese city on Saturday reported the country's first death from a new type of coronavirus, as the government braced for the Lunar New Year travel boom amid concerns over a possible outbreak similar to that of the SARS virus in the early 2000s.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said seven other people were in critical condition among a total of 41 who were suffering from pneumonia caused by a \"preliminarily determined new type of coronavirus” as of Friday. That was down from the earlier figure of 59. The others were in stable condition and at least two had been released from a hospital.\nThe patient who died was identified as a 61-year-old man who had been hospitalized after suffering shortness of breath and severe pneumonia. The commission said the man, who died Thursday, also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease and had been a frequent customer at a food market on Wuhan's outskirts linked to the majority of cases.\nChina says the cause of the Wuhan outbreak remains unknown, but has sought to quash speculation that it could be a reappearance of the SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChina's transport ministry says it plans additional measures to disinfect trains, planes and buses and prevent transmission of diseases during the 40-day travel rush centered on the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls this year on Jan. 25. The period began Friday and runs through Feb. 18.\n“The emergence of the epidemic may cause panic among people, especially in areas where people are concentrated during the Spring Festival travel period,\" the ministry's chief engineer, Wang Yang, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.\n“In order to further ensure the health of passengers, our ministry attaches great importance to the arrangements and deployment, and will focus on the disinfection monitoring and protection measures in areas with a large number of passenger travel volume, including transportation hubs, passenger stations and cargo hub plant stations,\" Wang said.\nPossible cases of the same illness have been reported in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan involving recent travelers to Wuhan. Health authorities elsewhere in China have yet to announce similar cases, despite the high population density around Wuhan and its role as a travel hub for central China.\nUniversity of Hong Kong disease expert Yuen Kwok-yung was Quote: d by the city's official news agency as saying that the genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus was 80% similar to SARS as it had been found in bats, civet cats and humans.\nYuen said that it was unclear whether the virus could further change to become more lethal, as the SARS virus had, but that Hong Kong had a robust system for detecting more severe problems among patients.\n\"So we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation,” Yuen said, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2020-01-11T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2020-01-11T17:39:00.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}

To conduct the study, the researchers looked at 44,230 cases of acute respiratory illness, in 36,157 patients, who were tested for 11 types of respiratory viruses over 9 years in Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland.\nIn the strongest study finding, patients with influenza A were approximately 70% less likely to also be infected with rhinovirus than were patients infected with the other virus types. In general, only 8% of patients testing positive for either rhinoviruses or influenza viruses were co-infected with another virus.\nThe contradictory relationship was also seen on a population level.\nSema Nickbakhsh, PhD, from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research at the University of Glasgow, said in a UK Research and Innovation press release, \"One really striking pattern in our data is the decline in cases of the respiratory virus rhinovirus, which is typically a mild common cold causing virus, occurring during winter, around the time that flu activity increases.\" Dec 16 PNAS study Dec 16 UK research and innovation press release\nMontana reports its first chronic wasting disease case in wild elk\nFor the first time, state officials in Montana have tracked chronic wasting disease (CWD), a deadly prion disease that affects cervids, in a wild elk. The animal was harvested on private land northeast of Red Lodge in November.\nAccording to ProMed Mail, the reporting system of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, Montana last reported CWD in captive elk in 1999.\nCWD was found in wild mule deer in Montana in 2017. Earlier this year, a moose in the state was also found to have the disease. In total, Montana's Fish, Wildlife, and Parks office has recorded 91 animals with CWD this year, with the rest in deer.\nMontana's general hunting season ended on Dec 1. Though there have been no documented cases of CWD jumping from animals to humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend testing all animals harvested from areas with known CWD transmission. Dec 14 ProMed post Dec 9 Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks news release\nMERS sickens 2 more in Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia over the past few days reported two new MERS-CoV cases, bringing the total for December to three, an apparent decline from November when 12 cases were reported.\nThe patients are 66-year-old man from the city of Abha in Asir region and a 72-year-old woman from the city of Riyadh, the country's capital, according to updates from the ministry of health (MOH). Neither of the people are healthcare workers and both had primary exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), meaning they probably didn't contract the virus from another known case. Contact with camels is listed as unknown for both.\nAsir region is southwestern Saudi Arabia, and Riyadh is located in the central part of the country.\nThe World said in an update earlier this month that since MERS-CoV was first detected in humans in 2012, it has received reports of 2,484 cases, at least 857 of them fatal. Most were reported from Saudi Arabia.
